a question for you  can you give me the name of an organization or aphilosophy or a political movement etc which has never had anythingevil done in its name  youre missing a central teaching of christianity man is inherently sinful  we are saved through faith by grace  knowingthat believing that does not make us without sin  furthermore not allwho consider themselves christians are even those who manage to headtheir own churches  not everyone who says to me lord lord willenter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father whois in heaven  matt 721again what historical documents do you trust  do you think hannibalcrossed the alps  how do you know  how do you know for sure  whathistorical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to discredit it as well as the bible haswell its really a shame you feel this way  no one can browbeat youinto believing and those who try will probably only succeed in drivingyou further away  you need to ask yourself some difficult questions1 is there an afterlife and if so does man require salvation to attainit  if the answer is yes the next question is 2 how does man attain thissalvation  can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certainmodern offshoots like the new age movement teach or does he require godshelp  3 if the latter in what form does  indeed in what form can suchhelp come  needless to say this discussion could take a lifetime and forsome people it did comprise their lifes writings so i am hardly in aposition to offer the answers here  merely pointers to what to ask  fewof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives certainly not methe spritual life is a difficult journey if youve never read a pilgrimsprogress i highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english languagenow i see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be aconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing  youwrote that i in my own faith accept and live my life by many if not mostof the teachings of christ  well christ referred to god as my fathernot my mother and while the maleness of god is not the same as themaleness of those of us humans who possess a y chromosome it does nothonor god to refer to him as female purely to be trendy nondiscriminatoryor politically correct  this in no way disparages women nor is it my intentto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns  after all godchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing christ into the humanpopulationwell im not about to launch into a detailed discussion ofthe role of women in christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in thelast 63 and for that reason i also apologize for any shortcomings in thisarticle  i just happened across yours and felt moved to reply  i hope imay have given you and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame ofmind something to contemplate,15,christian

unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think whenit comes to their religion some take it to the extreme and say thattheir religion is the only one and if you dont accept their teachingsthen you wont be saved it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claimto know what god thinkswants especially when its based upon yourinterpretation of a book the logic in the above statement is faultyin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both becorrect its all about perception no two people are exactly alikeno two people perceive everything in the same way i believe thatthere is one truth call it gods truth a universal truth or call itwhat you will i dont believe god presents this truth i think it isjust there and its up to you to look for and see it through prayermeditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people mayperceive this truth differently it doesnt mean one is wrong and theother is right as an example take the question is the glass halfempty or half full you can have two different answers which arecontradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to betrue does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong,15,christian

faq and darius response deletedi am myself an sda and i am in total agreement with what darius has to say  i also worship on saturday to honor the lord  your mention of esteeming all days alike imo has to do with the fast days observed by the jews  but no matter how you interpret that passage i do accept your worship on sunday as being done in honor of the lord in contrast with what many of my fellow sda believers may believe  to me though the bible overwhelmingly points to saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of gods deliverance of the israelites from egyptian bondage  to those who would attempt to point out that my observance of saturday is being legalistic this is simply not the case  rather keeping saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate gods goodness and gracethe idea was introduced to me once that the reason paul wanted the corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly wages  paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority before spending their money on other things  i do not have any proof in front of me for this though although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting  it would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the nt regularly worshipped on the first day  i assume that the christians in the nt regularly worshipped on the seventh day  but i agree with you that we only have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip was,15,christian

the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that areso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning  michaelsiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolutionof an argument over them turns on secular and culturalassumptions that are independent of these rules the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewedin part as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as ifhe has ultimate responsibility indeed many traditions presentan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpretloving ones neighbor as following various other rules andrelying on their god to make things come out right preciselybecause it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimateresponsibility once again we are confronted with good soundinggoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted  thereare many passages in the bible that in their most straightforwardreading show the christian god behaving in just this waymichael cannot refer to base claims or base commandments toshow that such readings are twisted because this divergence inunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the baseclaims and commandments  in addressing conservative christiansmichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notionsthat these conservative christians will reject  but these base commandments are too vague to serve as  aprinciple for the critique of ethical systems the meaning ofthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secularand cultural notions that the believer brings to them from howthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings ofother biblical passages from a particular sectarian traditionor from some combination of these things  these commandmentslack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis forcriticizing ethical systems  what meaning they have comes fromthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law whichwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand whatit means to love god and love our neighbors  there are manyparables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that arestraightforwardly read as ethical commandments  the paulineepistles are similarly full  if it is not clear that these allcome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behaviorthe problem is not a lack of raw material no michael the conservative christians also take the gospel seriously  what differentiates you is the way you interpret thegospelin a sense the wide variety of interpretations does tell ussomething about christianity  it tells us that the new testamentauthors left a sufficiently vague hodgepodge that it can serveas the source text for many vastly different beliefs about thenature of the christian god and about what men should andshouldnt do the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity perse that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians andgays  every christian principle he turns to this cause iseffective only through the extrachristian principles throughwhich michael interprets his religion and the homophobes applythe same christian principles with equal justification totheir cause  in short it is the extrachristian principles thatmake michaels christianity beneficial and i suspect they wouldbe as beneficial perhaps moreso without being filtered bychristian interpretation  michael paints a picture of standard american atheism as therejection of the evil in many conservative christianinterpretations of the bible  but i think it is even moredamaging to christianity to note that the new testament presentssuch a vague hodgepodge of notions about the nature of god andthe nature of the good except of course when it is ordered byan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles  here ithink we should apply a christian parable where a cold drink canhave its value and a hot drink can have its value but thelukewarm we should spit out ,19,misc
 i  jim    i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up  rallies i didnt beleive real people used it lets see if we agree  on the terms definition a homophobe is one who actively and  militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent  homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation  since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a  homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that  all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least    crap crap crap crap crap  a definition of any type of phobe comes from phobia  an irrational fear of  hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings the word is apparently in general use now  or perhaps it isnt in the bible   wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak  does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider  does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space  do you understand english  obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it  they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away  or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes  people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isnt that what i said what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merelyparenthetical to mine and add nothing useful    it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function  other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs  when the members of one generation pass along their traits to  subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if i  take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to  intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our  species at least is going nowhere    so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children hmmno wonder the world is overpopulated  obviously you keep to the monty python song  every sperm is sacred  and if as you say it has a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own  arguement naturalconsider the context im talking about an evolutionary function oneof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of aspecies procreate those who dont have no purpose in that context   another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to  survive the participation of both parents is necessary  a family must  exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they cannot constitute a  family since the majority of humankind is part of a family  homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you  will    well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have  vanished years ago due to nonprocreation  also the parent from single parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement dieby your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to yoursecond point you prove again that you have no idea what contextmeans i am talking about evolution the preservation of the speciesthe fundamental premise of the whole process   but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually  prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social  abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative  to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in  the most fundamental social element the family but wait theres  more    read the above  i expect you to have at least ten children by now with the family growing  these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be noone but more to do with pleasure  in prepill and precondom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children these days is just aint true  people can decide whether or not to have  children and when  soon they will be able to choose its sex c but thats  another arguement so its more of a lifestyle decision  again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children  both are  as unnatural as each otheryet another nonsequitur sex is an evolutionary function that existsfor procreation that it is also recreation is incidental thathomosexuals dont procreate means that sex is only recreation andnothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose   since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some  policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that  their sexuality is a preference a lifestyle an orientation a  choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is a mere  choice and if it is both contrary to nature and antisocial then it  is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they  became prominent     people are people are people  who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life  are you godtm  if so fancy a dateheres pretty obvious dodge do you really think youve said anythingor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement i am nottelling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are argumentsagainst the practice of homosexuality providing its a merely analternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonablycall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realizeof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a valueand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if youare to be consistent you have no case in this regard   to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to  ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of  the homosexual lifestyle but since the charge is only intended to  intimidate its really just demogoguery and not to be taken  seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for  suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start    again crap  all your arguments are based on outdated ideals  likewise the bible  would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by a bastard to eternal damnation  or someone who crushes his penis either accidently or not  both are in deuteronomyim sure your comment pertains to something but youve disguised itso well i cant see what where did i mention ideals outdated orotherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anythingat all to contribute   as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in  scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from  teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and  biological since any adult is a role model for a child it is  incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from  those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily  social though that could be extended easily enough      you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you  one mans meat is another mans poison what has this got to do with anything would you pick a single pointthat you find offensive and explain your objections i would reallylike to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly,0,atheism

  define perfect then   take your foot out of your mouth i wondered about that already when iwas a catholic christian the fact that the contradiction is unresolvableis one of the reasons why i am an atheist believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time but that showsthe power of religion and not anything about its claims   it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used letting evilhappen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evilis another evil   the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do evenbefore the omnipotent has created them there is no choice left all is knownthe course of events is fixed not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims   and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will you have saidsomething about choices and the scenario gives them therefore we havewhat you define as free will imagine the following i can do good to other beings but i cannot harm themeasily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of gooddeeds but dont make them long for them so they can not feel the absenceof good as evil but whose case am i arguing it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do itor it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent as well youhave to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroysthe credibility of the bible nothing less,0,atheism
  the argument goes as follows qoid quotes appear in john but not inthe almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they areconsidered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such andnot an entirely different source   we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usualexplanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not considertheir respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and lukethat of matthew and probably that of mark as it is assumed that john knew the content of lukes text the evidencefor that is not overwhelming admittedly   when they are from about 200 why do they shed doubt on the order onputting john after the rest of the three   sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would befine so whats that supposed to say am i missing something   that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and languagetogether with the theology are usually used as counterargument the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospelof john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare thatto reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societiesnot even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources  in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look likeand arguments based on mark are pretty weak,0,atheism

i think the passage youre looking for is the followingmatthew 517    think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophets i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew 518   for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished matthew 519   whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven matthew 520   for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there are several problems with this  the most serious is that thelaw was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews butnot on gentiles  there are rules that were binding on all humanbeings the socalled noachic laws but they are quite minimal  theissue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to doabout gentiles who wanted to follow christ  the decision not toimpose the law on them didnt say that the law was abolished  itsimply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to gentiles  thisis a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree toa discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recordedin acts 15however theres more involved  in order to get a full picture of therole of the law we have to come to grips with pauls apparentrejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation ofthe law  at least as i read paul he says that the law serves apurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded  again thisissue isnt one of the abolition of the law  in the middle of hisdiscussion paul notes that he might be understood this way andassures us that thats not what he intends to say  rather he seesthe law as primarily being present to convict people of theirsinfulness  but ultimately its an impossible standard and one thathas been superceded by christ  pauls comments are not the worldsclearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading  but theinteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position doesnot entail an abolition of the law  it still remains as anuncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removedfor its purpose of convicting of sin its important that it not berelaxed  however for christians its not the end  ultimately welive in faith not lawwhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different in theend i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion  thequoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets thelaw  the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal readingbut in fact thats not jesus approach  jesus interpretationsemphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonialdetails  indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the sabbath and kosher laws  some scholars claim that mat51720 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewishdiscussions  jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things thatreally matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity  mat 232325 this andthe discussion later in mat 5 suggest that jesus has a very specificview of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining thelaw in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of itpauls conclusion is similar  while he talks about the law beingsuperceded all of the specific examples he gives involve theceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath  he is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standardsthe net result of this is that when paul talks about the law beingsuperceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believethey are talking about different aspects of the law  paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision  as is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations hes looking at the aspect of thelaw that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewishceremonies  he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct  on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seemsto be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give paul so much trouble,19,misc

i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy  in the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass  itsdriving me crazy  the most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together because we all know how to do it  led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god  but the best masses ive been to were participatory prayerslately i think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportionof sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to dowhich is necessary because no one knows whats happening next is growingexample  last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church  usuallyon palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion takingthe role of the mob  the theology behind this seems profoundwhen we saycrucify him we mean it  we did it and if he came back today wed do itagain  it always gives me chills  but last week we were invited to sitduring the gospel passion and _listen_  besides the orwellian invitation i was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away  this seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward themusicians readers and so on  new things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows whats happening the new things have to beexplained and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the mass were justsitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is aboutto be done  in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of layexperts but that may not be just  i do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothingthats just a fact ofbureaucratic lifeeven though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the lords presenceso weve been wonderingare we the oddballs or is the quality of the massgoing down  i dont mean that facetiously  we go to mass every thursday orfriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of gods presence  but as far as the obligatory sunday massesmaybe i should just offer it up   has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in catholic masses lately,15,christian

ref encyclopedia of religion mircea eliademagi sneak preview later still eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeochristian religions as can be seen in the famous _oracles of hystaspes_ a work whose iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century ce widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the savior of the future saoshyant was the basis for the story of the coming of the magi to bethlehem in the _gospel of matthew_ 2112  the old persian word magu rendered in greek by magos is of uncertain etymology it may originally have meant member of the tribe as in theavestan compound mogutbish hostile to a member of the tribe this meaningwould have been further resticted among the medes to member of the priestlytribe and perhaps to priest benveniste 1938 boyce 1982 the term isprobably of median origin given that herodotus mentions the magoi as one ofthe six tribes of the medes  for a variety of reasons we can consider the magi to have been members of apriestly tribe of median origin in western iran among the persians they wereresponsible for liturgical functions as well as for maintaining theirknowledge of the holy and the occult most likely the supremacy of the medianpriesthood in western iran became established during the time of the medianmonarchy that dominated the persians from the end of the eighth centurythrough the first half of the sixth century bce until the revolt of cyrus thegreat 550 bce the persians were indebted to the medes for their politicaland civil institutions as well even if hypotheses have been advancedconcerning the existence of magi of persian origin in the achaemenid periodboyce 1982 we must still maintain that they were of median origin this isdemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of gaumata the magian mentioned bydarius i 522486 bce in the inscription at bisutun iran as well as bygreek sources indeed herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power ofthe medes against the persians through the conspiracy of the magi  the fact that the magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down thesacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude thepossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions this seems to beattested by the elamite tablets at persepolis  there is a theses put forth by giuseppe messina that denies that the magiare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members ofthe priesthood  a priesthood of purely zoroastrian origin this thesis isuntenable on the other hand the hypothesis that their name is related to theavestan term magavan derived from the gathic maga vedic magha gift isnot without foundation mole 1963 the meaning of maga can probably be foundin conformity with the pahlavi tradition within the context of the concept ofpurity or separation of the mixture of the two opposed principles of spiritand matter the maga which has been erroneously interpreted as chorus fromthe root mangh which is said to mean sing the magic song nyberg 1966 andhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica seems to be anecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision in any case thoughthere may be a relation between the old persian term magu and the avestan termsmagavan and maga we must maintain a clear distinction between the magi and theavestan priesthood the avesta ignores the median or old persian term despitea recent hypothesis proposed by hw bailey old persian inscriptions ignorethe avestan term for priest athravan vedic athravan even if this is perhaps present in an achaeminid setting in the elamite tablets of persepolis gershevitch 1964  the term magu has been present in zoroastrianism throughout its history thepahlavi terms moghmard and mobad represent its continuation the latter inparticular derives from an older form magupati head of the magi duringthe sasanid period third to seventh centuries ce which saw the formation ofa hierarchically organized church the title mobadan mobad the high priest ofhigh priests came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiasticalhierarchy  the magi practiced consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha av pahlkhwedodah they also performed a characteristic funeral rite the exposure ofthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse itthe corpse was not supposed to decompose lest it be contaminated by the demonsof putrefaction this practice later became typical of the entire zoroastriancommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in iran and among theparsis in india stone towers known as dakhmas were built especially for thisrite during the time of herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse wasin vogue only among the magi the persians generally sprinkled the corpse withwax then buried it the practice was widespread however among the peoplesof central asia  the magi were the technicians of and experts on worship it was impossible tooffer sacrifices without the presence of a magus during the performance of aritual sacrifice the magus sang of the theogony the magi were possibly thecustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about therelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the avesta and wascalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future the magi were alsoknown for the practice of killing harmful or ahrimanical animals khrafstrasuch as snakes and ants they dressed in the median style wearing pantstunics and coats with sleeves they wore a characteristic head covering offelt gr tiara with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the noseand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with theirbreath boyce 1982 the color of these caps in conformity with a traditionthat is probably of indoeuropean origin according to georges dumezil wasthat of the priesthood white  in all likelihood during the achaemenid period the magi were not inpossession of a welldefined body of doctrine and it is probable that theygradually adopted zoroastrianism they were most likely a clergy consisting ofprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturallyinclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have beenjealous guardians of the patrimony of zorastrian traditions by virtue of thisthey were the educators of the royal princes the wisest of them was responsiblefor teaching the prince the magic of zarathushtra son of horomazes and thusthe cult of the gods magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted withthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous andmaster of himself  during the achaemenid period the magi maintained a position of greatinfluence although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor despiteseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death ofgaumata the magian  in which according to herodotus who calls himselfsmerdis the persians killed a large number of magi to avenge the usurpation the magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in mediain persia and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationedas a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration  no priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the magi they wererenowned as followers of zarathushtra zoroaster as the teachers of some ofthe greatest greek thinkers pythagoras democritus plato as the wise menwho arrived guided by a star at the manger of the newborn savior inbethlehem and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in india but they werealso known as the chaldeans the priesthood of babylon known for its occultismthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in greeklike goes expert in the magic arts bidez and cumont 1938 indeed thechaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts especially astrology andhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge  to understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views itis necessary to distinguish between the magi of iran proper and the socalledwestern magi who were later hellenized in the achaemenid period both musthave been at least in part zoroastrian but the western magi those of theiranian diaspora in asia minor syria mesopotamia and armenia who came incontact with diverse religious traditions must have sooner or later and invarying degrees been influenced by syncretic concepts  the greeks were familiar with both kinds of magi and depending on theirvarying concerns would emphasize one or the other aspect of them classicalhistorians and geographers including herodotus and strabo document theircustoms while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines dualismbelief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theologyand eschatology those sources most interested in the doctrines of the magieven speak of zarathushtra as a magus in doing so they are repeating what themagi themselves said from the median and achaemenid periods when they adoptedzoroastrianism at that time they embraced zarathushtra as one of their own andplaced themselves under his venerable name  zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in theeastern community by the time of the acheamenids and was already adapting thoseelements of the archaic religion that refused to die it has been said quiteoften in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the magi in thezoroastrian tradition that the vendidad from vidaevodata the lawabjuringdaivas part of the avesta should be attributed to them this collection oftexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules andpractices nonetheless the hypothesis is hardly plausible since the firstchapter of the vendidad  a list of sixteen lands created by ahura mazda thesupreme god of zoroastrianism but contaminated by an attack by ahriman pahlgathicavestan angra mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source ofall evil and suffering  does not mention western iran persia or media theland of ragha mentioned in the text cannot be median raghiana furthermore ithas been noted gershevitch 1964 that if the authors had been magi theabsence of any reference to western iranian institutions including their ownpriesthood would be very strange  the magi were above all the means by which the zoroastrian tradition and thecorpus of the avesta have been transmitted to us from the second half of thefirst millennium bce on this has been their principal merit we can attributedirectly to the magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assumed known tous especially from greek sources and in part from the pahlavi literature ofthe ninth and tenth centuries ce according to this formulation the two polesof the dualism are no longer as in the gathas spenta mainyu beneficentspirit and angra mainyu hostile spirit but ahura mazda himself and angramainyu gershevitch 1964 see ahura mazda and angra mainyu this transformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of zoroastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the magi with themesopotamian religious world in this new dualism  which was that later knownto the greeks aristotle eudemus of rhodes theopompus and others  we cansee the affirmation of a new current of thought within zoroastrianism to whichwe give the name zurvanism see zurvanism  thanks to their adherence to zoroastrianism the magi played an enormouslyimportant role in the transmission of zarathushtras treachings as well as inthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically theirnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion ofzoroastrian ideas in the communities of the iranian diaspora the greeks beganto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them xanthus of lydiahermodorus aristotle theopompus hermippus dinon even writing treatiseson the persian religion of which only the titles and a few fragments havesurvived in the hellenistic period the magi were seen as a secular school ofwisdom and writings on magic astrology and alchemy were lent the authorityof such prestigious names as zarathushtra

i disagree  people marry each other  when they commit fully to eachother as life partners they are married  the ceremony may assist inemphasizing the depth of such a commitment but is of itself nothinggod knows our hearts  he knows when two have committed themselves tobe one he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fullygiving ourselves to another  the way i see it youd have to be livingtogether in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyoneknew if a marriage really existed but god knows  i dont think god keepsa scorebook,15,christian

michael bushnell writeswhich is exactly what i pointed out  though i was wrong about your useof the creed the 1913 catholic encylcopedia in which i read about itsaid the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque  apparently thathas changed  the athanasian creed has always had the filioque thenicene  constantinopolitan did not	of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicenecreed it wasnt there to begin with but they certainly did from theathanasian creed which did have it from the beginning	i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference inways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the eastemphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the fatherthrough the son and the west using proceeding from the father and theson  in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations seebelow	following therefore the form of these examples i profess that i docall god and his word  the father and and his son  two  for theroot and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and theriver are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two formsbut coherent ones  anything which proceeds from another mustnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not onthat account separated from it  where there is second however thereare two and where ther is third there are three  the spirit then isthird from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruitof the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the riverand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray	tertullian against praxeas 8 5 about 213 adand	i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the fatherthrough the son	tertullian against praxeas 4 1 about 213 adand as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part 1 question 36articles 2 and 3 there is no contradiction between the two methods ofgeneration and in fact the two methods of reckoning the processionemphasize what st augustine among others taught that the holy spiritproceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father ina more preeminent way	for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has itfrom the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him  for thefather alone is not from another for which reason he alone is calledunbegotten not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice oftheologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in amatter so great  the son however is born of the father and the holyspirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father givesto the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spiritproceeds jointly from both father and son  he would be called son ofthe father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of soundmind they had both begotten him  the spirit was not begotten by eachhowever but proceeds from each and both	st augustine of hippo the trinity 15 26 47 400 to 416 adso in a sense all of the formulations are correct to the west atleast because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son butin proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is theprocession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from thefather through the son but as all that the son has is from the fatherthe holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without anymention of the son being necessary	in any case i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of popest leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope stdamsus i st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambroseof milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among thefathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholicposition which i enunciated above	as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden iwill point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spokeof the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to producewrite or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined bythe fathers of nicea  that creed is a different creed than that ofconstantinople which is commonly called the nicene creed  not ofcourse in that they were condemning the adoption of theconstantinopolitan creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed ofnicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestoriouswho had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by thechurch which among other things denied the procession of the holyspirit form the son  thus the additions of the constantinopolitancreed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the councilchalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holyspirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have beenagainst explaining in a fuller way the creed for they themselvesapproved of previous additions to it  and if the further explanationsof the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the workdone by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it followsthat the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputedby the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the ariansin spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church untilmany years later under photius and others  and that the filioque wasnot disputed i provide more quotes below	since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed togod and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantlyclear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceedingfrom it	st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantialtrinity thesis 34 423425 ad	the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but heis the spirit of the father and the son  for it is written if anyoneloves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again itis written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ heis none of his  when the father and the son are named in this way theholy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospelthat the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shallreceive of mine and shall announce it to you	pope st damasus i the decree of damasus 1 382 ad	the onlybegotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor theappelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign tothe father  for the onlybegotten himself calls him the spirit of thefather and says of him the he proceeds from the father and willreceive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to theson but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spiritdivine  of god and he is god  for he is spirit of god spirit ofthe father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis likesoul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the fatherand of the son a third by appelation	the father always existed and the son always existed and the spiritbreathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created noris the spirit created	st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man wellanchored8 and 75 374 ad	concerning the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet isit necessary to speak  still on account of those who do not know himit is not possible for me to be silent  however it is necessary tospeak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and theson his sources	st hilary of poitiers the trintiy 2 29 356 to 359 ad	thus as i have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egyptpalastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that timeall have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrineexpressed by the filioque  i suggest to those of the orthodox churchthat they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of damascuswho all will admit denied the filioque to support their views  it isnot enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creedor the gospel of john for that says what we believe also  but it doesnot say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son only that he doesproceed from the father,15,christian

i wrote in response to dlecointgarnetacnsfsuedu darius_lecointewas paul a god too is an interpretation of the words of paul of higherpriority than the direct word of jesus in matt51419 paul beginsromans 14 with if someone is weak in the faith  do you countyourself as one who is weak in the faithyes but what does the bible have to say what did jesus say paulcloses romans 14 with on the other hand the person with doubts aboutsomething who eats it anyway is guilty because he isnt acting on hisfaith and any failure to act on faith is a sin gaus isbn0933999992have you read the ten commandments which are a portion of the law haveyou read jesus word in matt51419 is there any doubt in your mindabout what is right and what is sin greek hamartia  missing the markwhereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt51419 are fairlyclear are they notmatt51419 doesnt answer your questionbreaking bread  roughly synonymous with eatinghow do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments andjesuss word in matt51419or they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus word inmatt51419 actually stood for something perhaps they were strong inthe faithno i dont believe that paul can overrule god  however paul waswriting for a largely gentile audience  the law was regarded by jewsat the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles  thereare rules that were binding on all human beings the socalled noachiclaws but they are quite minimal  the issue that the church had toface after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted tofollow christ  the decision not to impose the law on them didnt saythat the law was abolished  it simply acknowledged that fact that itdidnt apply to gentiles  thus there is no contradiction with mat 5as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christians didcontinue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath  thus theycontinued to obey the law  the issue was and is with gentilechristians who are not covered by the law or at least not by theceremonial aspects of itjesus dealt mostly with jews  i think we can reasonably assume thatmat 5 was directed to a jewish audience  he did interact withgentiles a few times eg the centurion whose slave was healed and acouple of others  the terms used to describe the centurion see luke7 suggest that he was a godfearer ie a gentile who followedgod but had not adopted the whole jewish law  he was commended byjewish elders as a worthy person and jesus accepted him as suchthis seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing viewthat gentiles need not accept the lawhowever theres more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul onthe law  in order to get a full picture of the role of the law wehave to come to grips with pauls apparent rejection of the law andhow that relates to jesus commendation of the law  at least as iread paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in acertain sense superceded  again this issue isnt one of theabolition of the law  in the middle of his discussion paul notesthat he might be understood this way and assures us that thats notwhat he intends to say  rather he sees the law as primarily beingpresent to convict people of their sinfulness  but ultimately its animpossible standard and one that has been superceded by christpauls comments are not the worlds clearest here and not everyoneagrees with my reading  but the interesting thing to notice is thateven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the lawit still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iotaor dot may be removed  for its purpose of convicting of sin itsimportant that it not be relaxed  however for christians its notthe end  ultimately we live in faith not lawwhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different in theend i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion  thequoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets thelaw  the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal readingbut in fact thats not jesus approach  jesus interpretationsemphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonialdetails  indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the sabbath and kosher laws  some scholars claim that mat51720 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent jewishdiscussions  jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things thatreally matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity  mat 232325 this andthe discussion later in mat 5 suggest that jesus has a very specificview of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining thelaw in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of itpauls conclusion is similar  while he talks about the law beingsuperceded all of the specific examples he gives involve theceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath  he is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standardsthe net result of this is that when paul talks about the law beingsuperceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believethey are talking about different aspects of the law  paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision  as is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations hes looking at the aspect of thelaw that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewishceremonies  he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct  on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seemsto be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give paul so much troubleits unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways butwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts  look at theway terms like family values take on special meaning from thecurrent context  imagine some poor historian of the future trying tofigure out why family values should be used as a code word foropposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the us  ithink law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul wasinvolved in  paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish valuesthat go along with the term law any more than people who concernedabout the family values movement are really opposed to familyvalues,15,christian

one interpretation ive heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing ones wife  the husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her  he must honor her as his sister in christ  this would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayerthis verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is gods will for his family without consulting his wife  god reveals his will to both the husband and the wife  there needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making  even those whose understanding of the bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family  one way to look at it is that god speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife,15,christian

a few points about marys being taken into heaven at the end of her life onearthone piece of evidence for marys assumption into heaven is the factthat no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she wasburied some christian churches claimed to be located at the finalresting places of peter mark and other saints but no one everclaimed to possess the body of mary the greatest of the saints whybecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heavenalthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption ofmary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in revelationthat describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being crownedin the heavens of course the woman in this passage has otherinterpretations she can also be taken a symbol for the churchthe assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship tochrist  jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfilled therequirements of the law perfectly  under the law god gave to us weare to honor our mother and father and christs act of taking hismother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law also hetook his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not toallow her flesh to rot in the graveone last point an excatholic attempted to explain catholic doctrineon the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that marydid not die this is not a correct summary of what catholics believethe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid sayingwhether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among catholictheologians seems to be that mary in fact did die this would makesense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of thecross would want to share in his death,15,christian

this kind of argument cries for a comment  god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns   what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve  without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw          do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect andhas degraded ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favourof this statement shouldnt weperhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is fullof noncoding regions introns which are so called because theyintervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount ofevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it islikely that early exons represented early protein domainsis the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears thatintron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usuallyhave quite similar exonintron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been insertedlater presents several logical difficulties introns are removedby a splicing mechanism  this would have to be present but unusedif introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would haverequired _precise_ targeting  random insertion would not be toleratedsince sequences for intron removal selfsplicing of mrna areconserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves atrace  long terminal repeats and target  site duplications andthese are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology andgenetics before posting theological arguments like this try watsons molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimores molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective  my own  it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just differentscientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion  i think you misread my meaning  i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesnt mean its perfect now  it has certainly evolved sincefor the worse would you please cite a few references that supportyour assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientificperspective unless you support it by some evidencein fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhapsmore important than weve thought  for instance sex mighthave evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported bycomputer simulations of evolution eg tierra   perhaps  i thought it was higher energy rays like xrays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damagein fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage althoughit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action  actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life  according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago  after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created  it would still be too primitive to support life  i seem to remember a figure more like 25 to 3 billion years ago for the origination of life on earth  anyone with a better estimateid replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without onemost recent estimates of the age of the earth range between 46  48billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils butorganic stromatolitelike layers date back to 35 billion yearsthis would leave more than billion years for the first cells toevolveim sorry i cant give any references this is based on the courseon evolutionary biochemistry i attended here  dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterialviral and genetic  although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this  again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence forthis supposed degeneration i can understand scotts reaction  excuse me but this is so farfetched that i know you must be  jesting  do you know what pathogens are  do you know what   point mutations are  do you know that everything can come  about spontaneously    in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know thati hope you dont forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence againstthis conclusion in science one does not have to _believe_ in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do soand not to present ones own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubtit could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our wellbeing and ability to fight off disease while the  simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  causing infection and disease  it is a bad combination  hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseasesdisordersyou are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and virusesdo not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests ofa general principle of evolution  only replication saves replicatorsfrom degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods didnt make it to the present and for the last time  please present some evidence for your claim thathuman dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people haveclaimed that the opposite is true  we have suppressed our selectionand thus are bound to degrade i havent seen much evidence for eitherclaim  but then i ask so  where is this relevant to my discussion in answering johns question of why  why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies  is it gods fault the original question  i say no it is notof course nothing evil is gods fault  but your explanation doesnot work it fails miserably  you may be right  but the fact is that you dont know that satan is not responsible and neither do i  suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists  would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind  i dont think sohe could have done a much better job pun intended the problem isit seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they arejust as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that  where  seems to me like another bad inference actually what youve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context  i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting diseases  why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences  if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universei am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alonei would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeedfree this is an interesting philosophical question and the answeris not as clearcut as it seems to bewhat consequences would you expect from rejecting allah   oh i admit its not perfect yet  but im working on it  a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer  biology and genetics are fine subjects and

  i wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world  if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population ive been thinking about this every now and then since i cut my tieswith christianity it is surprising to note that a large majority ofpeople at least in finland seem to be apatheists  even though90  of the population are members of the lutheran church of finlandreligious people are actually a minority could it be possible that many people believe in god just in caseit seems people do not want to seek the truth they fall prey to pascalswager or other poor arguments a small minority of those who do believereads the bible regularly the majority doesnt care  it believesbut doesnt know what or how people dont usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestylethey only want to keep the virtual gate open a christian would saythat they are not born in the spirit but this does not disturb themreligion is not something to think about im afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossibledream religions have a strong appeal to people nevertheless  a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen tocoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that ourmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop too manypeople take the poison with a smile or just pretend to swallowand unconsciously hope god wouldnt notice   also how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking  the typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation so one is not intrinsically different from the other qualitatively  but then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ie how it expresses its own selfishnessif logic and reason are valued then i would claim that atheistic thinkingis of higher value than the theistic exposition theists make unnecessaryassumptions they believe in  ive yet to see good reasons to believein gods or to take a leap of faith at all a revelation would dohowever why do we value logic and reasoning this questions bearssome resemblance to a longdisputed problem in science why mathematicsworks strong deep structuralists like atkins have proposed thatperhaps after all everything _is_ mathematics is usefulness any criterionpetri,0,atheism

here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism ingeneral and archishop lefebvre in particular  he wrote it around1990  the first part of the twopart article was on the scandalousactivities of archbishop weakland in this country but i cut allthat  and i pared down the rest to what was relevantjoe buehlerschism and disobedienceaccording to st thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of thechurch united to him on first sight it would appear that whateverthe subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed above hemust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit tothe pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power ofjurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks of theology make itclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts ofdisobedience are schismatic if this were so as was noted at thebeginning of this article it would mean that the number of americanbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figuresthe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear inthe article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire detheologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who iscertainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre  he explains that schismand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused fathercongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existenceof legitimate authority in the church for example luthers rejectionof the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept adecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does notconstitute schism but disobedience  the catholic encyclopediaexplains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have tointend to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies  itadds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess thischaracter it must include besides the transgression of the command ofthe superiors a denial of their divine right to commandnot onlydoes mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to commandbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the popes authority andhis intention of never breaking away from rome the archbishop madehis attitude clear in the julyaugust 1989 issue of 30 days we prayfor the pope every day nothing has changed with the consecrationslast june 30 we are not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul iithe legitimate pope of the catholic church we dont even say that heis a heretical pope we only say that his modernist actions favorheresyintrinsically schismaticthe principal argument used by those claiming that mgr lefebvre is inschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate isan intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carries out such aconsecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic this isnot true if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act itwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the 1917code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension seecanon 2370 of the 1917 code pope pius xii had raised the penalty toexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismaticchurch in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishopsdiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvreas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the popethat is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and theillicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercisean apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction they have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations i do not wish to minimize in any waythe gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration ofbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than theordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of theprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the romanpontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting thechurch could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed inresponseit appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishops criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression  there is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation the new code ofcanon law includes a section beginning with canon 1364 entitledpenalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta thefirst part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of thechurch de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon1364 deals with the offense of schism which is evidently togetherwith apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offensesagainst the unity of the churchbut the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of thiscanon or indeed under any canon involving an offense againstreligion or the unity of the church the canon cited in hisexcommunication comes from the third section of penalties forspecific offenses which is entitled usurpation of ecclesialfunctions and offenses in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorumusurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question iscanon 1382 which reads a bishop who consecrates someone bishop andthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without apontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiaeexcommunication reserved to the holy seethe scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offenseof schism are then contrary to both truth and charity a comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages an accurateparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter hadbeen convicted of first degree murderi must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinionof laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law canon lawyerswithout the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiatedthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable fatherpatrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institutcatholique in paris noted in the 4 july 1988 issue of valeursactuelles that as i have just explained mgr  lefebvre was notexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiasticalfunction he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop whichconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon theillicitly consecrated bishop it is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel churchcardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for theauthentic interpretation of canon law commented on the consecrationsin the 10 july 1988 issue of la repubblica it would be hard to    the act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not    in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deals with    offenses is divided into two sections one deals with offenses    against religion and the unity of the church and these are    apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a    pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the    exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the    consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh    thuc in 1976 and 1983 although the archbishop was excommunicated    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because    there was no intention of a breach with the churchit is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecratingbishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the leastintent of establishing a schismatic church he is not a schismatic andwill never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly thatthe the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresyand that for the good of the church it was necessary for him toconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society canonlaw provides for just such a situation and even if one believes thatthe future of the society could have been guaranteed without theseconsecrations the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that itcould not means as canon law states clearly that he has not incurredexcommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelatesas archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it cannotexpect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against agreat and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted tothe service of the church and the salvation of soulsdr eric m de saventhem president of the international una voceassociation is one of the best informed laymen in the church and heknows the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre andthe holy see during the archbishops lifetime a

 in my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach science has its basis in observable fact id say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation isinterpreted and what significance its given depends a great deal onthe values of the observer science is a human activity and as suchis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other humanactivity the myth that scientists are above moral influence orethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and purefrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist is nonsensebill if one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective considering the meaning of the word objective i doubt that this will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality isthis may be an unfortunate choice of words almost selfcontradictoryobjective in the sense used here means something immutable andabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group ofpeople the first term is all inclusive the second is specific theconcept supposedly described may have meaning however if there is a god as described by the christians for instance thenhe has existence apart from and independent of humankind hisexistence is outside of our frame of reference reality if thisbeing declares a thing to be so it is necessarily so since he hasdefined himself as omnipotent and if his claims are to be believedhe is at least omnipotent relative to us god is intrinsicallyselfdefined and all reality is whatever he says it is  in anobjective senseif god determines a standard of conduct that standard is objectiveif human beings are held accountable for their conformance to thatstandard while permitted to ignore it they substitute a relativemorality or mode of conduct giving the term morality a nebulousmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending tomisunderstand the standard is objective and the conduct required tomeet that standard is therefore objectively determinedjust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality isinfinitely malleable doesnt mean that the objective standard itselfdoesnt exist morality has come to mean little more than a culturalnorm or the preferred conduct of decent people making it seemsubjective but it is derived from an absolute objective standardironically this objective standard is in perfect accord with our truenature according to christianity at least yet is condemned as beingcontrary to human nre oppressive and severe this may be due as,19,misc

responding to the moderatoryes i agree  what im trying to point out is that in matters of faithie tenets which are not logically persuasive one may be convincedof the truth of certain things through for instance personalrevelation  and its certainly fine to share that revelation or thosebeliefs with others  and i dont think that its arrogant persay toaccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself  where i think theconflict arises is in assuming that where disagreements on beliefsarise all others must have been given the same truth and that god must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree  i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest that they are rejecting something they know to be truth because it is inconvenient for them or because they wish to spurn godi would say that this is equivalent to assuming that all truths one holds are universal and absolute  and the problem i see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships withgod  this does not mean there is no absolute truth just that some areasof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or revealed that truth   comments criticism welcomekenalvinucsucoloradoedu,15,christian

rick anderson replied to my letter withra in article ra just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinionsit may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should i saybias but it is relevant to me and many others  youre right thebottom line is truth independant from you or anyone else  since youproclaim truths as a selfproclaimed appointee may i ask you by whatauthority you do this  because it says so in the bible  does thebible say so or is it you or someone else who interprets whether ascripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapprovalexcuse moi but your line of truths havent moved me one bit to persuademe that my beliefs are erroneous  of all the preachers of truth onthis net you have struck me as a selfrighteous member of the wreckingcrew with no positive message to me or other latterday saints whatsoeverbtw this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by jesusto the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lipsbut your hearts are far removed from me also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grantsophistry  look whos talking jumping to conclusions  you wouldnt dothat yourself right  all you address is your own convictions regardlesswhether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our pointsof view because you reject such interpretations without any considerationwhatsoever the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the samea beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentationof lds doctrine  the former kgb would have loved to employ youjesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of godcorrection it may contradict would you think the bible says  the bibleindeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that theybelong to or follow god in his footsteps  satan and his followers haverebelled against god and are not children followersredeemed of godbut it doesnt mean that they were not once created by god but chose toseparate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan ofsalvation        the field is the world the good seed are the children of the        kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one        matthew 1338kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesusand have shown works of repentance etc and the children of thewicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb  the issueof satans spiritoffspring and those who followed him has not beenaddressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible  youpurposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with nonrelated scriptureslots of nice scriptures deleted not

allow for otherfaiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a differentway or fashion than your own  not that it really matters the missionand progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mobor opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visitedevery continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear  this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but  rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read  something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teachessigh  what the bible teaches  or what the bible teaches according torobert weiss and co  i respect the former i reject the latter withoutthe remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus  on the contrary  and bythe way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant youbeing a christian following your own image of him as much as i am achristian following my own image of him in my heart  most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of  bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont  think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the  issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this  subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may  certainly bethe issue is of course that you love to use anything to either misrepresent or ridicule the lds church  the issue of official doctrineis obviously very important  mcconkies views have been controversialeg the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic   at bestor erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in thisdispensation  i respect him as someone who has made his valuablecontribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personalinterpretations his book mormon doctrine is oftentimes referred toas mcconkies bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine  i ratherlook to official doctrinal sources and to hugh nibleys booksthe last comment is an ldsinsider reference  summarizing mcconkiewas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom ofgod than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or

 always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beingsis not problematicbut as you put being the source of all existence including ones ownwould mean that god came from nothing a concept alien to christianity andtheism  it is better to understand the classical concepts of necessary andcontingent existence  god exists necessarily always  god createdcontingent beings  this is a coherent solution to existence so long asthe concept of god is coherent not a very good answer  if reason cannot by any means understand somethingthen it is likely that it is a null concept something not in reality,15,christian

darren in an earlier article i explained that what many people finddarren arrogant about christians is that some christians professdarren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrinesanddarren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sourcesdarren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your owndarren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspectthe point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint  while reason is a gift from god it is also infected by sinyet we do not reject reason entirelyand neither i think does darren  we need reason as darren himself has pointedout to comprehend gods revelation of himself in the biblebut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believethe word  we need first and foremost faith  for the sinfulmind is hostile to god  it does not submit to gods lawnor can it do so  romans 87luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelationsola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the useof reason with faith in comprehending that revelationyet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reasonrushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling likethe works which we do regards it as worthless largecatechism fourth part baptism  to make matters morecomplicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist  ive seen him described as a take no prisoners theologianwe might conclude given these observations that lutherwas inconsistent or mad  and surely at least some havecome to that conclusion  but it might be useful torecall that jesus was also called mad  and peter feltcompelled to defend himself and the apostles againsta charge of drunkenness on pentecost  so we as christiansought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad  rather we should imitate the bereans whoexamined the scriptures every day to see if what paulsaid was true acts 1711the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and manyothers preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holyspirit  this is not faith divorced from reason but a faith thatguides informs and uses reason  the spirit enables us to know thetruth and to proclaim it boldly  god does not want us to preach themessage that i think that jesus might have risen from the dead butrather i know that my redeemer lives  job 1925  the christiandoes not side with pilate in saying what is truth but ratherfollows christ who said in fact for this reason i was born andfor this i came into the world to testify to the truth  everyone onthe side of truth listens to me john 1837we can know the truth because god has promised us that we canknow the truth  jesus said if you hold to my teachingsyou are really my disciples  then you will know the truthand the truth will set you free john 83132  the proverbsurge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr 2323the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouthps 11943  evidently he believed that the word of truthwas in fact in his mouth  yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truthis motivated by selfglorification  but if we present thetruth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand readyto be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as lutherdid then we are not arrogant but humble  we should humblytrust in gods promise of truth just as we trust in hispromise of forgivenessrexlex it is only because of gods own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thingdarren but how far does that get you  once gods revelation stopsdarren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appearsi agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachingsof scripture and the products of our own reasoneven when suchreasoning is based on scripture  however i think i would drawthe line of distinction more reasonably    and less academicallythan you woulddarren for example lets suppose that our modern bible translationsdarren include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supperdarren and that jesus said exactly this is my bodydarren well presume that what he said was totally without error anddarren absolutely true  what can we be certain of  not muchdarren at the moment he stops speaking and people startdarren interpreting the possibility of error appears  did he meandarren that literally or not  we do not have any record that hedarren elaborated on the words  was he thinking of tran or condarren substantiation  he didnt say darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statementabout the lords supper  the lutheran approach is to saythat if jesus said this is my body then that is what weshould believe  other interpretations are rejected simply becausethey are not taught in scripturerecall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject  we alsohave pauls words in 1 corinthians 111734in which he passed on tous what he received from the lord  in particular he said forwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim thelords death until he comes  by these words we should believe thatthe bread that we eat in the lords supper really is bread as well asthe lords bodyas our senses in fact tell us  does this provethat transubstantiation is false  i suppose someone could say thatpaul spoke metaphorically of the lords body as bread simply becausethat is the way the body appears when we eat it  but this thought isfound nowhere in scripture  so we reject it  thus the primaryreason for rejecting transubstantiation is not that we canprove it false but that it is simply not found in scriptureside remarkive been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence isconsubstantiation  but it has been nonlutherans who have toldme this  we tend not to use the word  i almost think that thisis used more by professors of comparative religion who need labelsto compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lordssupper  but almost every church wants to call their own teachingreal presence because that was the traditional teaching of the churchend side remarkdarren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoningdarren can never lead them astray  when we implicitly claim that wedarren are infallible  the non christians around us rarely believedarren that implicit claim  witnessing is hardly going to work whendarren the person you are talking to believes that you are either toodarren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally tryingdarren to cover them upthis is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizationsin their witnessing  it is far better to take the approachid like to show you what scripture says  you decide for yourself whether to believe it or notdarren rexlex suggested that people read _he is there and he is notdarren silent_ by francis schaeffer  i didnt think very highly ofdarren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by manydarren evangelical christians  somebody else might like it thoughdarren so dont let my opinion stop you from reading itdarren if someone is interested in my opinion id suggest _ondarren certainty_ by ludwig

                            so that the                                  prophecy be                                   fulfilled                                              in considering the christian religion and judging itaccording to its claims it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier jewish prophecy  the scribe matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of jesus of nazareth  as you will see matthews mainstrategy is to take various old testament passages often not evenabout the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances inthe new testament  we must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts  since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after jesus was executed we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated  but for purposes of analysis wewill take particular claims at face valueimmanuel       we begin of course at the beginning       mt 12122  mary will bear a son and you       joseph will name him jesus which means gd is       salvation for he will save his people from their       sins  all this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet       isaiah 7116  in the days of ahaz c 750 bce       king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made       war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not       quite conquer it  when the house of david ie ahaz       and his court in judah were told of this its       heart and the heart of its people shook   and the       lord gd said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz        and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah       naturally saying ask a sign of gd your lord  it       can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven  but       ahaz said i wont ask i will not put the lord to a       test  then isaiah said hear then o house of       david  is it not enough for you to weary men that       you must weary my god too  therefore the lord       himself will give you a sign  behold a young woman       is with child and will bear a son and name him       immanuel which means gd is with us   he will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good  for before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings       you dread will have been desertedmatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics further he the hebrew word almah young woman asspecifically virgin  but this is not a prophecy about themessiah  it is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater  it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother  inshort it not about jesus  matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary  itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner a very general one it can be made to fit mary  maryvirgin or not was indeed a young woman with child  of coursethe fit is shady and has problems  jesus while thought of bylater christians to be gd walking among men was never called bythe name immanuel  if christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor jesus it becomes at best a cutandpaste prophecy a secondclass prophecy   not too convincingegypt       after jesuss birth in bethlehem matthew tells about aquick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if hewishes to liken jesus to moses  this was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod       mt 215  and remained there until the death of       herod  this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken       out of egypt i have called my sonwhat the lord really said was this       hosea 111  when israel was a child i loved him        and out of egypt i called my son  the more i called       them my people the more they went from me they       kept sacrificing to the baals and kept burning       incense to idolsmatthew conveniently omits the rest of hoseas oracle  but itwas indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted toreturn  this is history  jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere  and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we windup with a jesus that flees and resists gd   again this prophecyis just not as convincing as matthew probably had hopedrachel weeps        while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says thatking herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children  matthew then writes       mt 21718   by this that which was spoken by the       prophet jeremiah was fulfilled       a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud       lamentation rachel weeping for her children       she refused to be consoled because they were       no more   the reference is to a passage in jeremiah 3115 referring to thecarrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in 722bce  rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraimand manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are nomore  it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and diesbefore the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile       it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel whowas the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus andbethlehem were  if anyone should do weeping for her childrenit is leah  the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the cityon the way to ephrath bethlehem       as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred  one never knows but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the biblenor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far lessevil deeds of herod were carefully recorded  this might be aprime example of how events were added to jesuss life to enhancethe message of the churchs gospel       because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of theinfant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device setup by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesusit is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the jeremiah quote   the children the prophetspeaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire  gdcomforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will bereturned he will gather them back together  of course thiswould not suit matthews purpose as the children he speaks of aredead for good  again the prophecy matthew sets up is not eventhat and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not tooconvincingthe nazarene       we do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother matthean prophecy  after leaving egypt joseph  wifetake the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth        mt 223  that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarenefirst thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophets this time  second we have to ask who he is there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene  worsethere are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene  stillworse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament atall  in the book of judges an angel tells samsons mother thatshe will       judges 135  conceive and bear a son  no razor       shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth  he will deliver israel       from the hands of the philistinesthis is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of gd but it is the best that can be found  obviously matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cutandpaste prophecies in that he issimple making them up nowbearing ourdiseases       jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities       mt 817   this was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our       diseasesas expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of contextand a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme  we have       is 534  surely he the suffering servant has       borne our sickness and carried our painsfrom a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof israel jehovahs chosen servant and people  he speaks to theisraelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it  this image is deeply ingrained in jewishidentity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as theinstrument of the nations salvation by gd      the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline  they do not speak of a servant going around andhealing people  notice that the servant in isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews  jesusas we all know did not take the diseases onto himself  theverses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come butrather something that had already happened  while it is believedthat jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bearthe illnesses he healed  so while someone might want to saythat figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in hisspiritual atonement he has to admit that matthews parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effectsilent messiah      upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesusordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldnt arousethe attention of the local rulers       mt 121521  this was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet isaiah          behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved       with whom my soul is pleased  i will put my spirit on       him and he will announce justice to the gentiles  he       will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets  he will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his       namethe isaiah passage quoted reads       is 4214  behold my servant whom i uphold my       chosen in whom my soul delights  i have put my       spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the       nations  we will not cry or lift up his voice or       make it heard in the street  he will not break a       bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick  he will       faithfully bring forth justice  he will not fail       burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has       established justice in the earth  and the coastlands       await his lawyou see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passagebecause it does not suit the dealings of jesus  christians couldnever think of jesus failing never would the light of mankindburn dimly  but the servant nation of israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done  when the gentiles come to embracegd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all willbe the children of gd  also the ending phrase has been changedfrom the judaic the coastlands await his law to thechristologic the gentiles will hope in his name   while theoriginal proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name  if onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has onlyto read the whole chapter isaiah 42 and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant a people robbed andplundered   so we see that when matthews attempt atprophecy is examined it crumblesthree days andthree nights      now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god jesus himself  he speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection       mt 1240   for as jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights so will the son       of man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nightsbefore any further discussion can occur it is necessary to knowhow the jews understood days  as far as day names went each was24 hours long lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm  what was referred to as a day was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm  thus according to our timescale a sabbath day began at 6pm friday evening and lasted until6pm saturday evening  this is why the jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays it seems like a real miracle that christians didnt forget thatsaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week  thuswhen days and nights are referred to together 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of  thusjesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights      as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninthhour which is 3pm friday afternoon  he then was put into thegrave sometime after that  then jesus left the grave rosebefore dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath wasover  what this means is that jesus was using our time forclarity in the grave from 6pm friday night to some time before6am sunday morning  we could also add a little time before 6pmfriday since the bible is not specific here  what this meansusing jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day twonights and possibly a couple of hours of one day  certainly thisis a problem for jesus prediction  there is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights even using modern time measurements   we then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of matthews littlemistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgods mouth   and no matter who made the prediction it is morethan unconvincing it is counterconvincinghearing understanding     jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found ifyou were already one of the elect those chosen to understand themessage of jesus  he reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants  if the people cannot understandthem there is no need to bother with them since they will notaccept the plain message any better  matthew says       mt 131416  with them the audience indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says        you will indeed hear but never understand and you       will indeed see but never perceive  because this       peoples heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of       hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them her with their ears and       understand with their heart and turn for me to heal       themthe original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works hiscall to the ministry  this is in 740 bce when israel isflourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from gdcalling him to bring reform to israel and judah       is 6913  and gd said go and say to this       people hear and hear but do not understand see and       see but do not perceive   make the heart of this       people fat make their ears heavy and shut their       eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear       with their ears and understand with their hearts and       turn and be healed  then isaiah said how long       lord  and he said until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant and houses without men and the       land is utterly desolate and the gds take men far       away and forsaken places are many in the land  and       though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned       again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled the holy seed is its       stumphere we see that it is really gd who causes the people of israelto stop listening to the prophets warnings but reaffirms thepromise made to solomons and davids seedlineage  if you readthe rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the planof gd to use israel as a servant a light to the nations  lookat isaiah 421825 4820 493     we see that matthew has cutandpasted just a little portionof isaiahs verse to suit his own gospel needs  more than thathe has altered the words to make it fit the people who didntunderstand jesuss stories  and as we see isaiahs verses arenot prophecies but rather commands from gd to him in thepresent   once again matthews prophecy falls flat on its face      matthew tries again to make jesuss parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval       mt 1335  he said nothing to them without a       parable  this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables  i       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the worldmatthew really botches up here  he attempts to quote not from aprophet but from the psalms       ps 7824  i will open my mouth in parable  i will       utter dark sayings of old things that we all have       heard and known things that our fathers have told us        we will not hide them from their children but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lordas was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really comefrom a prophet  you might also want to know that earlier copiesof matthews gospel even inserted isaiahs name as this prophet apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up     perhaps the most significant part of this is that onceagain matthew has altered the old testament scriptures  as jesushas said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them  the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden further they speak of things known that our fathers have toldus  jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of theworld  indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms  nowonder matthew had to rewrite them   and still once againmatthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face  butchristians rarely look at this  matthews prophecies arent theonly things about christianity that are beginning to look badexcuses oflittle faith       in mt 171421 we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons except in one case  not knowing whatepilepsy was the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons  it is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to dispossess the epileptic  but jesus perhaps no moreenlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them sayingthey didnt have enough faith   this seems strange  why was thisdemon special  it seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not  apparently enough faith will allow someone to movemountains  of course you will find no one these days that canmove real mountains  no one parts seas  the only miracles thecharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips tomexico or some faraway place  major miracles are making some oldwomans arthritis feel better on sunday morning tv       and the gods including jesus are always shrouded inancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts  they are either dead sleeping or hiding inheaven with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone  yet life goes on       tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant timeor a distant place  gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days jehovah too  but now they are silent  all thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to seegod anymore       were too lazy were not zealous enough were       sinful its just his plan we put too many of our       own demands on gds appearance if we had the right       faith if we  were willing to meet gd on his terms     yet even the most pious of men have not seen gd  you dearreader have not seen gd  not literally you know that to betrue i know thats presumptuous and bold  but searching yourheart you know what i mean  all that weve seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing gd  they sayour little faith does not merit us to see gd  sometimes theysay see the love in these people you worship with see thelives of people change that is seeing gd   thus people getlulled to sleep satisfied with turning gd into the everydaysights   but that is not seeing gd as i am speaking of it isnot seeing gd the way people used to see        what we see in the world that is good is the compassion ofhuman hearts the love given and taken by men and women theforgiveness practised by christian  atheist alike beauty createdby the mind of man  these are the things that are done these arewhat we see  but it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faithjesus rides onan ass       shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiahking jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intojerusalem         mt 215  this took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet saying       tell the daughter of zion behold your king is       coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a       asscoltof course the passage quoted from zechariah 99 reads a littledifferently       lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and       victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass       colt he will command peace to the nationsthere isnt all that much difference here except that zechariahonly involves one animal  an asscolt  while matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently  thus he has jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass  from matthews version we get acomical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys  this could inevitably lead to a theologicalproctological dilemma   we find that in the account writtenearlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought tojesus  this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly andshows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he hasbungled  now excluding many respectable christians i have met ihave noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on assesthe situation is often reversed nowadays       then entering the jerusalem temple the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah  butjesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done       mt 2116  havent you read  out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praiseit is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesuswas never one to point out such little prophetic things andsince as we might expect the quote is in error which seems tofit matthews track record quite well  we might ask jesus ormatthew havent you read for the source reads       psalms 812  o yahweh our lord how majestic is       your name in the whole world   you whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avengerthe passages hardly need comment  there is no perfect praisespoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to gdnot his messiah king and not jesus  as mentioned it seems to bejust one more case of matthews pen making up convenient propheticscriptureyhvh said to my lord      jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewishmessiahking is to be descended  the jews agree it is kingdavid  but then jesus counters by quoting psalms 110       the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until       i put your enemies under your feettaken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidicdescent  one assumes he is in opposition to their answer  ofcourse the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying tomake some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiahking  its tempting to believe this if oneis a christian and not interested in matters of investigation but there are problems       in jesuss time the psalm was thought to be about themessiah  and it is easy to see why david might refer to themessiah as his superior  we need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great kingbringing the jews to times even better than those under davidsrule  of course the jews listening had no good answer and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as thechristians worship  the problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm an error that apparently several jews of jesuss time hadalso made  one must remember that there were various factionsamong the jews often as a result of different expectations of themessiahking  jesus was apparently one of these adventists likehis audience who thought the messiahs advent was imminent andwho interpreted psalms 110 among others as being messianicwhat is the problem then  psalm 110 literally reads       yhvhs utterance to my lord	sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your       footstool       yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion  rule       in the midst of your foes  your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains         you are a priest of the order of melchizedek       foreverthe word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord  but in the hebrew theword is adoni and no capitalisation exists  adoni simply meanslord a generic term as we would use it  it is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to gd  it is merely anaddress of respect        there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiahking  that this issupposed to be written by david is not certain  the title of thepsalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm aboutdavid  it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet about davids covenant and endorsement from gd  if thepsalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah  the idea of a perfect king descendedfrom david was not present in davids age  we have extensivetales of davids doings and sayings none of which include anypraises of a messiah     many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterdavid was dead in times of the exile when gd had put his show offavour for davids kingdom on hold       the description in the psalm fit david very well  david waspromised by gd a rise to power victory over his enemiessuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered  he achievedthe priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous kingenabled to bless the people   it all fits      we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alonethough  here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable  still thisevent is common to the other gospels too  so we let matthew offa little more easily this time  it is interesting to notethough how matthew dresses up the event  the earlier gospel ofmark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition ofan infant christianity be the target of jesuss question  as wemight expect matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the pharisees  such power is the penmoses  jesushad it togetherall along       we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see apseudoprophecy in johns gospel  the gospel story of johndeserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of jesuss career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse  the earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiahking and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby gd  when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people  while thiswas accomplished eventually under the rule of king david thechristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise  but to do so they expanded on thepromise preaching about a heavenly kingdom       john 856 jc speaking your father abraham       rejoiced to see my day  he say it and was gladit would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham butabraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testamentwhich corresponds to johns little prophecy  it is par for thecourse to see st john making up old testament backings just likehis forerunner matthew  many christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising theystill cling to itthe pottersfield      we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem byone of his followers judas iscariot   matthew writes       mt 27510  and throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple judas departed but the chief       priests taking the silver said it isnt lawful for       us to put it in the treasury since it is blood       money  so they bought a potters field with it to       bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet jeremiah       and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of israel and they gave them for the potters       field as the lord directed methis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testamentscripture  first matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet  it is zechariah who utters the verses whichmatthew makes use of       zech 111213  and they weighed out my wages       thirty shekels of silver  then yhvh said to me cast       them to the treasury the lordly price at which i       was paid off by them  so i took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       yhvhfirst of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah or of gd  the deal with a shepherd most likelya priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before gd would send judah and israel into conflict withone another  the word treasury had been replaced by the kingjames scholars with to the potter precisely because this madematthews quote fit better  but this is a blatant error  thecorrect translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which alsomakes perfect sense in zechariahs context whereas pottersfield is totally unrelated  whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation  however givenmatthews track record one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty      of course matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext  the thirty pieces of silver match judass situation and ifas most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy totoss around  however the correct translation of zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with judas and the highpriests  the high priests would not put the money in thetreasury  the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly theopposite  of course to the average thursdaynight bible studentthe prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at newtestament face value  to those matthews work is convincingenoughwine vinegar casting lots      then jesus is led away to be crucified       mt 273435  they gave him vinegar to drink       mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not       drink it  and when they had crucified him they       divided his garments among them by casting lots that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet       they parted my garments among them and upon my       vesture did they cast lotsfirst of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sourwine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly  we findthat right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink not polluted with gall       jn 192830  jesus said i thirst  a bowl of       vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth  when he       had received the vinegar he said it is finishedbut matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from theprophets but one from the psalms       ps 692028  i looked for pity but there was none       and for comforters but i found none  they gave me       poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and       for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  add       to them punishment upon punishment may they have no       acquittal from thee  let them be blotted out of the       book of the livingof course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his requestof drink  this does indeed seem to be a show of pity  the psalmquoted is about david and his political and military enemies  itis not about the messiah or jesus  it is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the jesus in thepsalm asks gd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas thejesus of the gospels says       lk 2334  jesus said father forgive them the       dont know what they dofurther matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall a bitter substance put into jesuss drink not hismeat as the psalm stipulates       with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturallyask what of the casting of lots  this brings up the 22ndpsalm which deserves discussion all by itself  suffice it now tosay that the fact that jesuss clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing  it turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days  as we will soon see it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus  it doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofjesuss clothes  for a man so removed from worldly possessionshis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicionsthe 22nd psalm      this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies  it becomes a song ofpraise to yhvh and of hope  taken out of context parts of itseem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well  wewill examine the primary passages       verse 12  my god my god why have you forsaken me        why are you so far from helping me far from the words       of my groaning  oh my god i cry by day but you       dont answer and by night but find no restjesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus ratherthan king david  of course the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to jesus or his execution  jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like thelamb led mute before its shearers  indeed jesus doesnt do muchgroaning even when on the cross  he certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross       68  but i am a worm and no man scorned by men        all who see me mock at me  they make faces and wag       their heads  he committed his cause to yhvh  so let       him deliver him for he delights in himthis seems to fit jesuss execution pretty well with theexception of the holy messiah being called a worm       1213  many bulls encompass me they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion       1618  yea dogs are round about me a company of       evildoers encircle me they have pierced my hands and       feet  i can see all my bones they divide my       garments among them and cast lost for my raiment       1921  but you yhvh be not far away  deliver my       soul from the sword my life from the power of the       dog  save me from the mouth of the lion and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bullit would seem quite convincing and im sure the early christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too  unfortunatelythis prophecy has a fatal flaw  the words have pierced reallydo not exist in the psalm  the correct hebrew translation is       16  yea dogs are round about me a company of       evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my       hands and feetin hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb formwhich can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character  theword in the hebrew text is literally like the lion kaariwhich makes sense in the context and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer  it is convenience thatwould urge a christian to change the word to kaaru   but toadd the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this isjust what the christian translators have chosen to do  while thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring tojesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators       apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm does not lenditself to jesus so easily  verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross  this naturally fits thepsalms true subject king david  as a side note we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but ratherthe forearms  this doesnt say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms  but then facts arent bound by our religious beliefs      matthew escapes culpability this time as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordjesus  but the psalm like many others was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of jesuss life and death  how much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for christiantheology  it is easy to see for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament mighthave been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew  butit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims  so far this has not said goodthings for st matthewthe reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesusscrucifixion  johns gospel recount written about 70 years afterthe fact tells us at jesuss execution       jn 193437  but one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear and out came blood and water       these things took place that scripture be fulfilled       the will look on him whom theyve piercedof course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext   prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofisrael will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war withthem       zc 12710  and yhvh will give victory to judah       and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations       that come against jerusalem in judah  and i will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on       jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn childjohns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatmatthews attempts  matthew at least usually excontexts morethan just one passage  johns errors are grossly obvious andblatant here  it does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were foundedreckoned withtransgressors       after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe jewish kingship messiahship   according to one version ofthe gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves       mk 1527  and with him they crucified two robbers       one on his right one on his left  and so the       scripture was fulfilled which says       he was reckoned with the transgressorshere mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah 53about the servant nation of israel  the passage is not about themessiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah 53 and itssurrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation  theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast not a prediction of what is to come in any event  theservant is thought of as a criminal  this also happens to fit thedescription of jesus  had the passage really been about themessiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah  jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry  he wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer   locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons       mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified withjesus also reviled him 1532  this is to be expected from acouple of robbers  of course in his later recount st lukedecides to change some things  luke tells us       lk 233943  and one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed arent you the messiah save       yourself and usthis certainly fits with marks recount which tells how thepeople who crucified jesus said save yourself and that therobbers did the same  but then luke goes on       but the other criminal rebuked the first saying       dont you fear gd since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation  and we indeed justly so       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds        but this man has done nothing wrong and he said       jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom        and jesus answered verily i say to you today you       will be with me in paradisenow this little dialogue seems highly contrived  it stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech  we have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering   such a manapparently noble and of principle doesnt seem likely to havebeen a robber  we wonder at the amount of theatrics created byluke  of course lukes recount also disagrees with marks  luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both  it is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of gd do not have this avenue open  this is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an old testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology  in this casethe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we haveseenthe end of theworld       mt 24       now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the new testament  it is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity  jesusmentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings andhis disciples ask him about this and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about       the disciples tell us when will this the temples       destruction be and what will be the sign of your       coming and of the close of the age       jesus take care that no one leads you astray for       many will come in my name saying i am the christ         you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for       this must take place but the end is not yet   for       nation will rise against nation all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs             they will deliver you up put you to death       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray       but he who endures to the end will be saved  this       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a       testimony to the nations and then the end will come             so when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to       the mountains             immediately after the tribulation of those days       the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from       heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man       in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn       and see the son of man coming and he will send out       his angels and gather his elect             learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know       that summer is near  so also when you see all these       things you will know that he is near at the very       gate  truly i say to you this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place             but of the day and hour no one knows not the       angels not the son but only the father therefore       you also must be ready for the son of man is coming       at an hour you do not expectfrom this it is clear that jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples  he tellsthem that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that itwill come and thus they must be ready  theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit  he told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the endand that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to beswept away      there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the bible and said that the phrase this generationshall not pass away really means this race of people will notpass away  of course the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greekhe didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear  but it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples atleast some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the apostles responses  it becomes abundantly clear fromrev 227 1 peter 47 1 john 218 and rev 2220 that jesusmeant exactly what he said  the end was very near       for 2000 years christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether  for 2000years they have waited for their executed leader to come backhearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon surely he must be  all we must do is wait  can you imagine howtired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting forjust the right moment to spring       so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazarethjoshuabenjoseph died   it is said that after three days orthree days and three nights or three periods of time or threeeternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divineradiance  then the saviour decided it wasnt in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven  so the story goes anyway as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down  to themjesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture  we haveseen though that this matter is quite shaky  but throughoutchurch history christians have held fast to faith in simplebelief  what doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question  to question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters  thus for 2000 years theprophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largelyaccepted  things may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianityhave been accepted and used properly or improperly to supportwars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of whichchristianity can securely keep hold,0,atheism
   please enlighten me  how is omnipotence contradictory  by definition all that can occur in the universe is governed by the rules of nature thus god cannot break them anything that god does must be allowed in the rules somewhere therefore omnipotence cannot exist it contradicts the rules of nature  obviously an omnipotent god can change the ruleswhen you say by definition what exactly is being definedcertainly not omnipotence you seem to be saying that the rules ofnature are preexistant somehow that they not only define nature butactually cause it if thats what you mean id like to hear yourfurther thoughts on the question,0,atheism

archivename atheismintroductionaltatheismarchivename introductionlastmodified 5 april 1993version 12begin pgp signed message                          an introduction to atheism                       by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism  whilst ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint  iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions somerelevant books are listed in a companion articleto provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist  all thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on altatheism since the newsgroup was created  some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion articleplease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a christian viewpoint  this is because the faq files reflectquestions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christianswho proselytize on altatheismso when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such aschristianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing  much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of itmay notwhat is atheismatheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of godsome atheists go further and believe that god does not exist  the former isoften referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strongatheismit is important to note the difference between these two positions  weakatheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god  strongatheism is a positive belief that god does not exist  please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheistssome atheists believe in the nonexistence of all gods others limit theiratheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than makingflatout denialsbut isnt disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesnt existdefinitely not  disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true  not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot  which brings us to agnosticismwhat is agnosticism thenthe term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of themetaphysical society in 1876  he defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowablethus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether god existswords are slippery things and language is inexact  beware of assuming thatyou can work out someones philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic  for example many peopleuse agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only whenreferring to strong atheismbeware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning itis very difficult to generalize about atheists  about all you can say forsure is that atheists dont believe in god  for example it certainly isntthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universeso what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheismthere are many philosophical justifications for atheism  to find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist its best to ask hermany atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religionsis essentially selfcontradictory and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a god could exist  others are atheists through scepticism because theysee no evidence that god existsbut isnt it impossible to prove the nonexistence of somethingthere are many counterexamples to such a statement  for example it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers  of course this deals with welldefined objectsobeying welldefined rules  whether gods or universes are similarlywelldefined is a matter for debatehowever assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provablyimpossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the nonexistence ofgod  if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counterexampleif on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found to show that it isnt there  such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible  there is no such problem with largestprimes because we can prove that they dont existtherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do  even theists follow this rule most ofthe time they dont believe in unicorns even though they cant conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhereto assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested  we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be toprove that he doesnt exist anywhere  so the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can testthose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of godexists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of god described by followers of various religions  so whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may bepossible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist  it may even be possible to prove that no god describedby any presentday religion existsin practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no god exists  however it is sufficiently differentthat counterarguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofgod are not really applicablebut what if god is essentially nondetectableif god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interactionmust be measurable  hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectableif god is essentially nondetectable it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way  many atheists would arguethat if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of noimportance whether he exists or notif the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelitessurely he should still be detectable todaynote that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientificallyverifiable physical way  it must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish himfrom all the other things that dont existok you may think theres a philosophical justification for atheism but isnt it still a religious beliefone of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is theredefinition game  the cynical view of this game is as followsperson a begins by making a contentious statement  when person b points outthat it cant be true person a gradually redefines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept  hethen records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed toit and continues  eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it  rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play alongthe point of this digression is that the answer to the question isntatheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant byreligious  religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power  especially in some sort of god  and by faith andworship its worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not  religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense  widening the definition ofreligious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well  such asscience politics and watching tvok so its not a religion  but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion isfirstly its not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes insecondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience  most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubtscience has a number of core assumptions  for example it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers  these arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make  if such basic ideas are calledacts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith and the term loses its meaningfaith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in somethingaccording to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith  of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is certain  this is not ageneral tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe existsfaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proofsceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit that definition as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs  strong atheism is closer but still doesnt really match aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data orthe lack of it when asserting that god does not existif atheism is not religious surely its antireligiousit is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for oragainst friend or enemy  the truth is not so clearcutatheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that senseit can be said to be antireligion  however when religious believersspeak of atheists being antireligious they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theiststhis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfairatheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrummost atheists take a live and let live attitude  unless questioned theywill not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends  ofcourse this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable inmany countriesa few atheists are quite antireligious and may even try to convert otherswhen possible  historically such antireligious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the eastern bloc countriesto digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separationof church and state just like the usa  soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished  the institution of state atheism came about whenstalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the populationsome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business  for examplethe government of the usa  such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separatebut if you dont allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely thats the same as state atheismthe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief  in particular itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innaturereligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters  forexample religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms  even today many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns  so long as they campaign concerning secular mattersand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their saywhat about prayer in schools if theres no god why do you care if people praybecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do thingsthat those who dont pray cant just ignore  also christian prayer inschools is intimidating to nonchristians even if they are told that theyneed not join in  the diversity of religious and nonreligious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public eventalso nonprayers tend to have friends and family who pray  it is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time even without othermotivesyou mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid  what about atheists  why arent there any atheist charities or hospitals  dont atheists object to the religious charitiesthere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to  some atheists contribute to religious charities as well forthe sake of the practical good they do  some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basismost atheists seem to feel that atheism isnt worth shouting about inconnection with charity  to them atheism is just a simple obvious everydaymatter and so is charity  many feel that its somewhat cheap not to sayselfrighteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefsto weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is arather strange idea its rather like holding a party to say today is not mybirthday  why the fuss  atheism is rarely evangelicalyou said atheism isnt antireligious  but is it perhaps a backlash against ones upbringing a way of rebellingperhaps it is for some  but many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheistsits also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different  on theother hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of otherson the whole we cant conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independentlyhow do atheists differ from religious peoplethey dont believe in god  thats all there is to itatheists may listen to heavy metal  backwards even  or they may prefer averdi requiem even if they know the words  they may wear hawaiian shirtsthey may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes  manybuddhists lack a belief in any sort of god  some atheists even carry a copyof the bible around  for arguing against of coursewhoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it  atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearanceunexceptional but arent atheists less moral than religious peoplethat depends  if you define morality as obedience to god then of courseatheists are less moral as they dont obey any god  but usually when onetalks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptablewrong behaviour within societyhumans are social animals and to be maximally successful they mustcooperate with each other  this is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from antisocial or immoral behaviour purely for the purposesof selfpreservationmany atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans  so why do they carewhat happens to others  they dont know they simply are that waynaturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to useatheism to justify their actions  however there are equally many people whobehave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify theiractions  for example  here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ   came into the world to save sinners  but for that very reason i was   shown mercy so that in me  jesus christ might display his unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life  now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god   be honor and glory forever and everthe above quote is from a statement made to the court on february 17th 1992by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukeewisconsin  it seems that for every atheist massmurderer there is areligious massmurderer  but what of more trivial morality   a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior   deteriorated after born again experiences  while only 4 of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being born again 12 had done   so after conversion  similarly 5 had used illegal drugs before   conversion 9 after  two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation 5 after                                freethought today september 1991 p 12so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviouris there such a thing as atheist moralityif you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then theanswer is yes as explained above  many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious peopleif you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answeris no  atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave  most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theistsbut for different reasons  atheists view morality as something created byhumans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural beingthen arent atheists just theists who are denying goda study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over 90 of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem  they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around thematheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they areunbelievers through choice  the vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth  they havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefsthis decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of thatindividuals personality  for a naturally sceptical person the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly makebut dont atheists want to believe in godatheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them  manyof them have no desire to be watched over no matter how goodnatured thebig brother figure might besome atheists would like to be able to believe in god  but so what shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true  the risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious  atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough there must be evidence for the beliefbut of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god  they are unwilling in their souls to seemany if not most atheists were previously religious  as has been explainedabove the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that godexists  many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach godof course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closedmindedcomments such as of course god is there you just arent looking properlyare likely to be viewed as patronizingcertainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for god  if you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate isfutileisnt the whole of life completely pointless to an atheistmany atheists live a purposeful life  they decide what they think givesmeaning to life and they pursue those goals  they try to make their livescount not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on  for example an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform in the hope of leaving his mark on historyit is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in randomevents  however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thingthat has a meaningto put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask  some atheists believe that asking what is themeaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee  they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just isso how do atheists find comfort in time of dangerthere are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even petsor on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tvthat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but sowhat  should individuals believe in things because they are comforting orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might bein the end its a decision for the individual concerned  most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable  they put truth before comfort and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy thats justhard luckdont atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrongthe short answer is no do youmany atheists have been atheists for years  they have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusivethousands of years of religious belief havent resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of god  atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about itso why should theists question their beliefs dont the same arguments applyno because the beliefs being questioned are not similar  weak atheism isthe sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing  strong atheismis a negative belief  theism is a very strong positive beliefatheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause  not just to the believersbut to everyone elsewhat sort of harmreligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind  its notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildingsthink of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so onimagine how that effort could be better spentmany theists believe in miracle healing  there have been plenty of instancesof ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result  some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious groundsit is arguable that the catholic churchs opposition to birth control  andcondoms in particular  is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythirdworld countries and contributing to the spread of aids worldwidereligious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligionthose werent real believers  they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excusewhat makes a real believer  there are so many one true religions its hardto tell  look at christianity there are many competing groups allconvinced that they are the only true christians  sometimes they even fightand kill each other  how is an atheist supposed to decide whos a realchristian and who isnt when even the major christian churches like thecatholic church and the church of england cant decide amongst themselvesin the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone whocalls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions should be considered a christian  maybe some of those christiansare just perverting christian teaching for their own ends  but surely ifthe bible can be so readily used to support unchristian acts it cant bemuch of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldnt he havemade it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefsarent a perversion of what your god intendedif there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your saysosorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murderedothers because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him achristianobviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned  but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsensethat does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialoguepositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones  nobody has ever proved that unicornsdont exist but that doesnt make it unlikely that they are mythsit is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default  of course weak atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better stillwell if atheisms so great why are there so many theistsunfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correctit is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrologygraphology and other pseudosciencesmany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods  certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understandof course theres more to religion than that  in the industrialized worldwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations  religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as wellbut so many cultures have developed religions  surely that must say somethingnot really  most religions are only superficially similar for example itsworth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort ofconcept of god in the christian senseof course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so itsrather odd to use one religion to try and justify anotherwhat about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god existsfor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one whodoes not  besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it  also it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leadersa famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight  manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertiseso are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothingnot entirely  it certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so farthe theory of memetics talks of memes  sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds by analogy with genes  some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others  some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressureto keep onetime believers from admitting that they were mistaken  somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memesof course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme  religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught iteven if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages  what are the fundamental messages of atheismthere are many important ideas atheists promote  the following are just afew of them dont be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions   there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules   be especially sceptical of positive claims   if you want your life to have some sort of meaning its up to you to   find it   search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable   make the most of your life as its probably the only one youll have   its no good relying on some external power to change you you must change   yourself   just because somethings popular doesnt mean its good   if you must assume something assume something its easy to test   dont believe things just because you want them to be trueand finally and most importantly   all beliefs should be open to questionthanks for taking the time to read this articlemathewbegin pgp signatureversion

so instead of calling it interest on deposits you call it returns on investementsand instead of calling loans you call it investing in business that is in other wordsfloating stocks in your company no interest is different from a return on an investment  for onething a return on an investment has greater risk and not a set returnie the amount of money you make can go up or down or you might evenlose money  the difference is the risk of loss is shared by theinvestor rather than practically all the risk being taken by theborrower when the borrower borrows from the bankbut is it different from stocks   if you wish to call an investor in stocks asa banker well then its your choice relabeling does not make it interest free it is not just relabeling as i have explained aboveit  is relabeling also its still not interest free the investor is still taking some money  asdividend on his investment  ofcourse the investor in islamic banking its yourso called bank  is taking more risk than the usual bank but its still getting something back in return  also have you heard of junk bonds vinayak                                           vinayak dutt                                   email vdpmayoedu             standard disclaimers apply,0,atheism

replyto pwhiteemproscom  here in america people tend to think of choosing a church much like theythink of choosing a car or a country club what i mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants ratherthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process people tend totreat church as they would a club and when something is less than totheir liking off they go to another onei think that scripture presents the idea that god takes a different perspective on the church choosing process it seems to me from 1cor 12that god doesnt subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at allbut that he places us in the body as he wants us so i think a betterquestion is not how do i choose a church but how do i figure out wheregod is trying to place meif a person was instrumental in leading you to christ the church theygo to is a logical first choice you have been born into the family ofgod people should hop around from church to church as often as theyhop from natural family to familyif you met the lord on your own so to speak there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters here you are morelike an orphan prayerfully go and leave yourself on a few doorstepsand see if anyplace feels like home i wouldnt expect that god want to place you in a church where youhave difficulty fitting in with the people but on the other handthere are no perfect churches if you have an attitude of lookingfor problems you will both find them and make them on the other handif you have an attitude of love and committment you will spread thatwherever you go in general i think that god will try to place you in a church thattalks about the lord in the way that you have come to know him and isexpanding on that base,15,christian

is not the same as quoting theorder  taken out of context words can be interpreted muchdifferently than had one applied them within the confines oftheir original expressioni think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta frater superior of the order to which i belong  when he included that bitfrom merlinus x he did us all a service  he showed us the extremesto which order members have been known to go in their fervori have little knowledge regarding reuss background but surelyhe was an unusual man and he was an important force in the order for many yearsyet as people change so do orders change and while we look backso carefully at the dirty laundry of oto remember that this isonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassedwhich extend beyond any one individual  i hope to show that therewas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the orderitself perhaps by testing the limits myselflet us examine this issue a bit more closelyin 1895 karl kellner 18501905 a wealthy austrian industrialistand paper chemist as well as a highgrade mason founded the ordotempli orientis  kellner had traveled widely in the east where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices  kellners efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franzhartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked togetherprior to joining the oto  the order was first proclaimed in 1902in reusss masonic publication oriflamme  on kellners deathreuss succeeded him as outer head oho  the jubilee edition ofthe oriflamme published in 1912 announced that the order taughtsecret of sexual magic theodore reuss was an interesting character  born june 28 1855 inaugsburg he entered masonry in 1876  he was a singer journalist andpossibly a spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialistleague founded by karl marxs daughter and her husband  reuss waslater associated with william wynn westcott a leader of the goldendawn who later introduced him to john yarker  yarker chartered reuss tofound the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany  after severalattempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on thedevelopment of the otothe order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadershipfor example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlinand h spencer lewis in the usa  in 1912 the historic meeting betweenreuss and crowley occurred  crowley wrote that reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing order secrets  when crowley looked at it afreshthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time  reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of allthe english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the equinoxreuss resigned as outer head of the order in 1922 after suffering astroke and named crowley his successor  all was well until 1925 when_the book of the law_ was translated into german  there was a breakin the continuity of the order  manyk members split with the new ohoover the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the orderhe had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reusss request deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation_an introduction to the history of the oto_ by ad veritatem ixwithin _equinox iii10_ edited by   hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus    caliph of the united states of america      published by samuel weiser 1990there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included thismaterial in _equinox iii10_  and this is the real point is it notwhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization  does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principleof thelema  or is he exercising his true will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers  a picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretationsit is quite easy for me to see for example that all of oto derivedout of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them  and ican take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeblesupport of the law of thelema is laughable at bestwould i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way  will i  i think notwhy  because my frater will see it as a perspective an interjectioni am using as an example  my illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at firstso it may be with oto and merlinus x  please look oto more carefullyi do not support reusss words myself as i am not qualified to assessthem and i am critical of their pomposity  if i who am a member ofthe order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so thenwhat can this say about the health of the order  does it mean thatthe order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles  ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmaticrequirement  how shall we resolve these two possibilitiesi find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientisthey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information  they are quite often artists and geniuses  having met some 20 longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are orwere very heavily involved with the order i can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it standsi have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta  in these moments i followed my intuition and ive found little to stop me from requestinga second initiation from a different oto body  im happily participatingin social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnosticmass well enough for my tastes this doesnt make me an authority on order politics and explanations howeveri can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on mylimited contact with other membersi urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far  there are manyways to interpret words and many people who have become involved withthe order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual visioni welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in responseto

deal withthe eternal plurality in the godheadirenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists  however hewas uncomfortable with the twostage approach  he still viewed god asone personage with distinctions that did not become fully visibleexcept through his process of selfrevelation the economy  thedistinctions are present in his essential nature  irenaeus emphasizedthe holy spirit more

possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god  we certainly cant conclude that hes an atheist thoughsubject the bible proves ittypical postingin the bible it says thatresponsemost of the readers of altatheism feel that the bible is of questionableaccuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who wererecording oral tradition that existed many years before  thus any claimedtruth in it is of questionable legitimacy  this isnt to say that thebible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before beingacceptedmany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage issubject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing andone thing only is not legitimatenote that this feeling tends to extend to other booksit is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore otherequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religionsubject pascals wagertypical postingif you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you dont believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go tohell therefore it is foolish to be an atheistresponsethis argument is known as pascals wager  it has several flawsfirstly it does not indicate which religion to follow  indeed there aremany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there  this is oftendescribed as the avoiding the wrong hell problem  if a person is afollower of religion x he may end up in religion ys version of hellsecondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to beincorrect you have lost nothing is not true  suppose youre believing inthe wrong god  the true god might punish you for your foolishnessconsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine infavour of prayeranother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely  or at least that they are of comparable likelihood  if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive  so sadly theargument is only likely to convince those who believe alreadyalso many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition  it is not a matter of will or costbenefit analysisformally speaking the argument consists of four statements  1 one does not know whether god exists  2 not believing in god is bad for ones eternal soul if god does     exist  3 believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist  4 therefore it is in ones interest to believe in godthere are two approaches to the argument  the first is to view 1 as anassumption and 2 as a consequence of it  one problem with this approach inthe abstract is that it creates information from no information  this isconsidered invalid in information theory  statement 1 indicates one has noinformation about god  but statement 2 indicates that beneficial informationcan be gained from the absolute lack of information about god  this violatesinformation entropy  information has been extracted from no information atno costthe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions  theproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states thechristian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption theargument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your intereststo believe in god  a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascalintended the argument to be viewedthe biggest reason why pascals wager is a failure is that if god isomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes asa wager  he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at allwhether people believe in himsubject what is occams razortypical postingpeople keep talking about occams razor  what is itresponsewilliam of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occams razor  in its original form it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily  that is if you can explain something without supposingthe existence of some entity then do sonowadays when people refer to occams razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simplest solutionthe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us1 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there whichcame into being as a result of natural processes2 there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who created the universe  clearly this god must be of nonzero complexitygiven that both explanations fit the facts occams razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two  solution number oneunfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution3 there isnt an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there  we just imagine that there isthis third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why its good to believe in jesustypical postingi want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my

himresponseeinstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in thechristian god  used this way it is out of context it refers to einsteinsrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermoreeinsteins religious background was jewish rather than christiana better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the followingi believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony ofwhat exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions ofhuman beingseinstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in anobjective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to randomevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer  he believed thatqm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need forstatistical interpretations  so far no such better theory has been foundand much evidence suggests that it never will bea longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion asymposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religionin their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york 1941  in  the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature  for him   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an   independent cause of natural events  to be sure the doctrine of a   personal god interfering with natural events could never be   refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot   but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal  for a doctrine   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm   to human progress  in their struggle for the ethical good teachers   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal   god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past   placed such vast power in the hands of priests  in their labors they   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable   of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity   itself  this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably   more worthy task  it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions   a lie which is being systematically repeated  i do not believe in a   personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly   if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our   science can reveal itthe latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press  also from the same book  i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind    itof course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is falsesubject everyone worships somethingtypical postingeveryone worships something whether its money power or godresponseif that is true everyone is a polytheist  theists

causetypical postingsets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member sochains of causes must all have a first element a causeless causeresponsethe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but hasno smallest memberfurther even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that doesnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity andespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured byany particular religionsubject the universe is so complex it must have been designedtypical postingthe presence of design in the universe proves there is a god  surely youdont think all this appeared here just by chanceresponsethis is known as the argument from designit is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in theuniverse those who believe that the complexity and diversity of livingcreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read thenewsgroup talkorigins for a whilethere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate herehowever the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour ofsocalled scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidenceobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of theuniverse and life on earththe origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence ofsomething as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable thatsurely it cant have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaosdeliberatelybut if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mindcapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings mustbe immeasurably more unlikely  the approach used to argue in favour of theexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationistpositionthis leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universewhat created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability  the only way out is to declare that the creator was notcreated and just is or wasfrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universejust is without introducing a creator  indeed stephen hawking in his booka brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closedand finite in extent with no beginning or endthe argument from design is often stated by analogy in the socalled watchmaker argument  one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch onthe beach  does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that itevolved naturally  of course one assumes a watchmaker  yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creatorthe watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all arguments by design  firstly a watchmaker creates watches from preexisting materials whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing  these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weaksecondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world  if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldnt assume it was created by the watchmaker  the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creationfinally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature  yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order  the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistentsubject independent evidence that the bible is truetypical postingthe events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentaryevidence

incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system  technicallyspeaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decisionprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal systemessentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox  the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false  note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidablethe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claimsthat godels incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible toprove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolationone can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove theexistence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof howeverit may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axiomsthat both atheists and theists agree with  it may then be possible to showthat godels incompleteness theorem holds for that system  however thatwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god existswithin the system  furthermore it certainly wouldnt tell us anything aboutwhether it is possible to prove the existence of god generallynote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing aboutthe actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractionsanother frequent claim is that godels incompleteness theorem demonstratesthat a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever cannot beboth consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formalsystems so such claims are nonsensesubject george bush on atheism and

 more correctly when people die they cease to exist the idea ive gotten is that to christians hell is  like heaven  afterlife ie you dont cease to exist but are subjected to eternal  torture well thats the orthodox idea anyway eternal death if you prefer that atheists dont believe in any sort of afterlife i think its safe to say that hell was never intended metaphorical certainly not the equivalent of ceasing to exist some christian concepts are indeed metaphors but your idea of hell is a 20th century interpretation it is of course nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview  of modern age but i fear the church will not accept it understandably per haps because if you accept that hell is a metaphor then youre one step closer to turning god into a metaphor as well,15,christian

hello src readersagain the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodoxchurches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had a discussionabout it a while ago then ofm comments with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaborationis needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issueof the coptnet newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposedto the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria playedleading roles in  christian theology  they were  invited everywhere to speakabout the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of theecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year 430 ad it was saidthat the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend  all theirtime in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politicsstarted to intermingle with  church affairs  it all started when the emperormarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of stdioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later  exiled to this interferencewas clear you have nothing to do with the church  these political motivesbecame even more  apparent in chalcedon  in 451 when the coptic  church  wasunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  eutyches who believed  inmonophysitism this  doctrine maintains that the  lord jesus christ  has onlyone nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divinethe coptic  church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it wasportrayed in the council of chalcedon  in  that council monophysitism meantbelieving in one  nature  copts   believe that the lord   is perfect in  hisdivinity  and he   is perfect in  his humanity  but  his  divinity  and hishumanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate wordwhich was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria  copts thus believe in twonatures human and   divine  that are   united in   one without minglingwithout confusion and without alteration from the  declaration of faith atthe end of the coptic divine liturgy  these  two  natures did not separatefor a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from  the declaration of faithat the end of the coptic divine liturgythe  coptic church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  council  ofchalcedon  perhaps the council  understood   the church correctly but  theywanted to exile the  church   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  egyptianindependent pope despite  all of this  the coptic church  has remained verystrict  and steadfast in its faith   whether it was   a  conspiracy from thewestern churches to exile the coptic church  as a  punishment for its refusalto be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus  didnt  quite go theextra  mile to  make the  point that  copts  are not  monophysite the copticchurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile semantic differences betweenall  christian  churches   this is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117thsuccessor  of  st mark pope shenouda iii  to the  coptic church faith ismore  important  than  anything and   others  must know that  semantics  andterminology are of  little importance to us  throughout this  century  thecoptic church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement thecoptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it hasremained a member of that  council  since 1948 ad   the coptic church is  amember  of the all  african council of churches  aacc  and the  middle eastcouncil of  churches mecc  the church    plays an  important role   in thechristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  thetheological differences with the  catholic greek orthodox presbyterian andevangelical churchesas a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did signa common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitismwas condemned so the

groups the alexandrians andantiochenes  it adopted language that was intended to be acceptableto moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes  i agreethat there were extremes that were heretical  however in the courseof the complex politics of the time it appears that some people gotrejected who didnt intend heresy but simply used language that wasnot understood or even was mispresented  and some seem not to havejointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine  there aregroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps  thisposting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians  there are alsoa remaining nestorians  like some of the current socalledmonophysites there is reason to believe that the current socallednestorians are not heretical

the argument for lukes genealogy being that of mary is very weak accordingto luke 323   and when he began his ministry jesus himself was about    thirty years of age being supposedly the son of joseph   the son of eliaside from the fact that mary is not mentioned there are two possibleinterpretations either joseph was her father or he was her brotherclearly this is not acceptable  a third would be that joseph the sonof eli was her father and just happened to have the name as the manto whom she was betrothed but that would seem to be grasping atstraws the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had nointention of tracing marys genealogy in which case he would havenamed her but that he traces her husbands from davids son nathanthe matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from davidsson solomon to joseph  matthew 116 reads   and to jacob was born joseph the husband of mary by whom was born   jesus who is called christ there are two apparent problems  the first is how to reconcile thetwo paternal genealogies  which diverge with the sons of davidsolomon and nathan  the second is why is any genealogy of josephrelavent at all if joseph had nothing to do with it  if joseph wasnot jesuss physical father then the original poster is quitecorrect that claims for jesuss messianic heritage are not based ontruth but only on appearances whatever jesuss divine nature wasthe second problem is easy in my mind  we assume that joseph was notinvolved in the conception of jesus in any way  however a holyspirit capable of working a physical conception in mary is alsocapable of employing the physical agency of josephs seed in thiswork  in our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its losssolely in terms of a physical act whereas it is really a matter ofpurity on a much higher level as well  the important thing is thatneither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them theyhad not knowneach other  thus the first gospels dedication ofhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of joseph is quite relevantto jesus the virgin birth not withstandingto the first question there is an answer that creates to begin with moreproblems than it resolves  it is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely differentsets of parents  except for the names of the parents and the child and the birthplace in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories  matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty yearslater with the baptism of jesus in jordan  rudolf steiner offered hisexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then convergewith their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth  he did not derive hisresolution from biblical study or speculation or from other externaldocuments and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyondthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup  in any case thedetails are described in steiners the spiritual guidance of the human being and of humanity the gospel of st luke and the gospel of stmatthew whether or not rudolf steiners methods and explanation are acceptedas valid at least this interpretation resolves the apparentcontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intactas for the passing of ones jewishness through the mother this wasnever an issue with jesus no one ever questioned his or marysjewishness  the issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternalline of descent from david the king,15,christian

 this is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism ie the  belief that you cant deny anything that you cant prove doesnt exist this is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them  according to the above poster we must believe in objects or beings that havent been proved not to exist so why stop at god   there could be a huge number of beings identical to ronald reagan except for trivial differences say one is missing a finger one has blond hair and they all live  on other planets so we cant see them  the  reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of god how did they shoot themselves in the foot  there is a big difference here stalin didnt say that he stood for a   particular moral position ie against murder and terrorism etc and  then did the opposite like the religious movements he was at least  an honest killer  this is not a support of stalin but an attack on this  viewpoint  saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic look at all the  russians that helped stalin that werent atheists  dont they contradict  your point  besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant  to his murdering people this is just the common assumption that atheists  cant value life as much as theists which you didnt support   ah and heres another point you didnt get out of the faq  an atheist doesnt have to hold the positive view that god doesnt exist heshe may just have the nonexistence of the positive belief  heres the example  strong atheism  i believe god does not exist   a positive belief weak atheism    i dont believe in a god       a negative belief  these are not the same some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable  or lets look at it this way in sets  suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that i will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not  so if s  santa then es no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa  but notice that even es  no  is itself another idea  this means you have lots of cases  christian   aeayesbebno     gegyes where g  god  atheist strong  aea    gegno  atheist weak  ae     ie no g at all in the set  agnostic   ag eg  indeterminate e   nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always   prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival  trait evolution has drilled it in us to take positions even false ones,0,atheism

  i have found that this isnt a very effective argument  most atheists areperfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of jesusbut arequite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into misunderstandings hoaxes or simple fabrications  they can always make ananalogy with the _iliad_ a book that tells the story of the historical trojanwar but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations  i dont think its possible to convince atheists of the validity of christianity through argument  we have to help foster faith and anunderstanding of god  i could be wrongare there any former atheists here whowere led to christianity by argument,15,christian

reply to zazenaustinibmcom e h welbon    for many atheists the lack of belief in gods is secondary to anepistemological consideration  what do we accept as a reliable way ofknowing  there are no known valid logical arguments for the existenceof gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist  mostphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one thatmust be accepted on faith  faith is belief without a sound logicalbasis or empirical evidence  it is a reliable way of knowing there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absenceof any possibility of proof  even when we agree to take someone elsesword on faith we just mean that having found this person to bereliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source nowif we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidenceeverywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge aboutgods the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally thenone of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowingrather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faithis in gods or no gods  the theist believes that faith is an acceptablebasis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable atother times for example in his work as a scientist  the atheistbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliableknowledge  agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position thantheism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all otherknowledge  without evidence why should we believe in gods rather thansanta claus or the easter bunny i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesntrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods  i dont believe thatthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge  atheism is the best andsimplest theory to fit the lack of facts and so should be held untilcontrary evidence is found,0,atheism

the same way that any theory is proven false  you examine the predicitionsthat the theory makes and try to observe them  if you dont or if youobserve things that the theory predicts wouldnt happen then you have some evidence against the theory  if the theory cant be modified to incorporate the new observations then you say that it is falsefor example people used to believe that the earth had been created10000 years ago  but as evidence showed that predictions from this theory were not true it was abandoned,19,misc

this is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine                        the doctrine of godi   the persons of the godhead     of all of the doctrines of scripture this is the most     important  the bible is preeminently a revelation of god      therefore our first objective in studying the bible should     be to know god     i believe that the bible teaches that there are three     persons in the godhead trinity  god the father god the     sonthe lord jesus christ and god the holy spirit  i     believe that they are individual persons who are one in     nature meaning that they are identical in nature each     possessing the same divine attributes  they are also     equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience     cf matt2819 2 cor1314 john 14891617ii  the attributes or characteristics of the godhead     a  gods nature is revealed in the name he has taken for         himself jehovah  he is the living god eternal and         unchanging  he is without beginning and without         ending  cf isa428     b  god is a spirit  cf john 424     c  god is love  cf 1 john 4816         as such he is gracious merciful good faithful         patient and full of lovingkindness  cf psa 8912         psa 1038 nahum 17     d  but god is also holy and righteous  he is absolutely         without sin in his nature and so is incapable of         sinning in though word or action  cf ex 1511 isa         63     e  god is omnipresent everywhere present at the same time         in the completeness of his person omniscient all         knowing knowing all thingsthe end from the beginning         infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with         unlimited power over all creation         god is infinite in his presence wisdom and power  it         is my conviction that the work of the lord in our day         has become very mancentered and that the people in our         churches know very little about god  i believe that the         lords work needs to be godcentered and that the         people of god need to understand that god is sovereign         in all things  in the affairs of nations in the lives         of all people and in the carrying out of his purposes         regarding salvationiii     the works of the godhead     a  in creation          all three persons of the godhead were active in          creating and all three are active in sustaining          creation and in ordering the course of human affairs          for nations as well as individual people to the end          of time  cf gen 112 john 113 col 11617          heb 13     b  in salvation         in order to understand salvation i believe that it is         absolutely necessary to begin with god not with man          all three persons of the godhead have been and are         active in salvation         1  god the father             salvation originated with god  the members of the             godhead determined in eternity past that there would             be salvation the conditions under which people             could and would be saved and even who would be             saved  election to salvation is recognized in             scripture as the work of  god the father  cf eph             134 2 thess 21314         2  christ the son of god             the lord jesus christ through his birth by the             virgin mary came to the earth to accomplish two             important works             a   he came as the final and complete revelation of                  god the father  cf col 115 heb 113             b   he came to provide salvation for all whom the                  father had chosen  he did this by his death on                  the cross by his bodily resurrection and by                  his present intercessory work in heaven  the                  work of salvation will be completed for us when                  the lord returns  cf rom 5810 1 cor 153                  4 heb 725 1 john 32         3  the holy spirit             as the author of scripture the theme of which is             christ and his redemptive work the holy spirit is             carrying out the redemptive plan of god in the             following ways             a   he convicts of sin cf john 16711             b   he regenerates known in the bible as the new                  birth  cf john 358             c   he indwells each believer to fulfill the work                  of sanctification  cf john 141617             d   he seals every believer in christ thus making                   salvation secure  cf eph 11314             e   he baptizes every believer into the body of                  christ  cf cor 1213             f   he teaches every believer the truth of                  scripture cf john 1426             g   he bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                   god for ministry  cf 1 cor 12             h   he restrains sin  cf gal 51626             i   he empowers for living and for service

 excellent question timothy i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  as we can not understand the mind of god but to attempt to answer you  clearly god of the bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  intends to judge mankind the first test is those who have beleived that jesus  christ is the son of god and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god  the bible calls this sin for those who die before the end of the worldhave  already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche  god must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world however  there is no plus and minus system for god he has declared that he can not  tolerate spiritual imperfection thus he can only based your worthiness to  live with him on the wrong in your life   good people yes even christians are going to constantly sin before god the  christian hoever thanks god that christ has given his life for his sins  penalty the proscribed punishment for sin is death just as the proscribed  punishment for robbery is time in jail god then cannot ask for anything but  punishement for those sins he does not want to condem the bible says in john  317 that god did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  through him it might be saved when i realize that i have sinned and i do  with painful regularity i must approach god and ask him to not hold thew sin  against me i have that right and privlige only because of christ as for jews  they are promised that they must believe on the messiah who would come and  dis come in jesus of nazereth muslims i fear have been given a lie from the  fater of lies satan they need christ as do us all  for those who dont have that right in the view of the bible they stand  olone in their defense are you going to hell i can not answer that for you  i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  hell that step is much more rewardingstan toney stoneyoystersmcmedumy opinions are my own you may borrow them,15,christian
   if the papacy is infallible and this is a matter of faith then the    pope cannot be wrong  if on the other hand this is not a matter    of faith but a matter of church law then we should still obey as the   pope is the legal head of the church   in other words given the doctrine of infallibility we have no choice   but to obeythis is a primary problem in the church today  what you are saying ismore or less heresy  you might call it infallibilism  its theidea that the pope is always right in everything he says or doesthis is virtually all over the place especially in this countrythe pope is only infallible under certain very specific andwelldefined conditions  when these conditions are not met he canmake mistakes  he can make big mistakesa couple historical examples come to mindbishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of theenglish catholic church  at one point during his career the reigningpope decided to install one of his nephews in an english see  bishopgrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body thoughmaybe not in so many words you have to treat popes with respect evenwhen they are wrong  the problem was that this nephew would justcollect the income of the see and probably never set foot therethis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd  bishopgrosseteste was quite right in what he didanother example is that of pope john xxii a pope of the middle ageshe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatificvision until the last judgement  he decided that this should be adefined doctrine of the church  though he didnt quite get around todefining it  now theres no way this is compatible with catholicdoctrine  the popes doctrine was criticised by many in the churchhe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail even  inthe end he had to admit his mistake  shortly before he died herecanted  his successor made the exact opposite idea a dogma of thechurchif you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of suchsubjects such as st robert bellarmine a doctor of the church youwill find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fallinto heresy or schism,15,christian

disclaimer throughout this post there are statements and questions whichcould easily be interpreted as being sarcastic  they are not  i have writtenthis reply in the most evenhanded manner that i can with no emotions boilingto the surface as it was written  please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that i make every attempt to make fun of noone except myself 	hmmm  there are other animals on this planet with advanced	mental facilities which have not developed religion as a	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained  why is this so	further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the	unexplained  why is this so  the other animals on this planet	including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly	content in their ignorance	id like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me	from your unsupported statement  they are 1 humans are animal	only 2 religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need	not be researched 3 religion was made up by humans to address a	perceived need 4 the biological aspect of humans is deified that	is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical	structure with biology at the apex	needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion 1 and the	underlying presuppositions	i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult  it has	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia	that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is	infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides	a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this	is the case	i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants	hope and purpose  rather it points an individual to the one	source of hope and purpose  there is nothing hidden about a	christians source for hope and purpose  of what usefulness to	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose	and externally given hope and purpose  is the apparent loss of	control over ones own life the problem or is it something else	finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following	christian moral standards  indeed the sole reason for the existance	of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people	from their imperfections  moral standards are merely guides to the	christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian	in the person of gods spirit	heaven is one of two final states that	christian doctrine postulates  however christians are generally	not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this	promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived	benefits to them in the hereandnow	many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a	priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this	as a priority for his followers  however it is not the penultimate	priority as evangelism is normally understood ie preach the word	convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum	rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting	the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits	of a christian lifestyle  this demonstration should be so powerful	that it compels the nonchristian to seek out the christian to ask	why  needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom	plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it	does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian	is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of	friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot	evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or	harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a	conversion	as a longtime christian nearly 20 years i view with some skep	ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurryup	attitude  pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no	conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes she was	coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now	the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings	conviction of wrongdoing to people  i am content to do my part	witness and let the spirit do the rest	we are far more than animals  we sleep eat reproduce and die	just as other animals do  true  but we are also capable of more	than this  if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is	so limited i can only hope and pray  that you will someday find	a more expansive view	for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing	arts that humans do  how is it that humans can learn the language	of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so	how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social	structures whereas other animals have only one structure	blatant assertion  christianity is not physically addictive	christianity is not psychologically addictive  christianity is not	a thing which one snortsingestsshootsup it is a relationship	with a living being  you might as validly characterize any close	knit relationship with this appelation	there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship	and christian living gain and retain the upper hand  even so	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these	things flow	guilty by association  that christianity which forces itself	upon another is not christianity at all	you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened	2000 years ago  how did you come by it	i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole	result of the roman sack of jerusalem in 70ad  he was 30 years	gone by this time  it strains the bounds of credulity to assert	that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy _until_ the sack	christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself	what do you know of him,15,christian

for srcin most languages the feast of the resurrection of our lord isknown as the pasch or pasque or some variation thereof a wordwhich comes from the hebrew pesach meaning passover in englishgerman and a few related languages however it is known as easteror some variation thereof and questions have been asked about theorigin of this termone explanation is that given by the venerable bede in his deratione temporum 15 where he derives the word from the name of ananglosaxon goddess of spring called eastre bede is a greatscholar and it is natural to take his word for it but he lived673735 and augustine began preaching in kent in 597 the use ofthe word easter to describe the feast would have been wellestablished before the birth of bede and probably before the birthof anyone he might have discussed the subject with it seems likelythat his derivation is just a guess based on his awareness thatthere had been an anglosaxon goddess of spring bearing that nameand the resemblance of the words thus if the said resemblancesurely it is not surprising that a personification of spring shouldhave a name similar to the word for dawn is not in istelfconvincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by bede doesnot make it more soassuming that bede was right that would not justify saying that thechristian celebration which after all had been going on for somecenturies before the name easter was applied to it has pagan rootsit would simply mean that the anglosaxons upon becoming christiansand beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a festival everyspring called it by the name that to them meant simply springfestivalhowever bedes is not the only theory that has been proposed  jknoblech in die sprach zeitschrift fuer sprachwissenschaft 5vienna 1959 2745 offers the following derivationamong latinspeaking christians the week beginning with the feastof the resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white weeksince the newlybaptized christians were accustomed to wear theirwhite baptismal robes throughout that week sometimes the week wasreferred to simply as albae translaters rendering this intogerman mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn theyaccordingly rendered it as eostarum which is old high german fordawn this gave rise to the form easter in english yours james kiefer,15,christian

  many pagans are involved in environmentalismthis is only natural sincerespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations  thisdoesnt mean that environmentalism is wrong any more than supporting peace inthe middle east is wrong because jews and muslims also work for it  nonetheless paganism is certainly on the rise and we as christians shouldaddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to christianity  likeit or not pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should beand isnt    i believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity hasforgotten  this doesnt mean that paganism is right but it does mean that wehave something to learn from the pagan movement  first paganism respects the feminine  christianity has a long history ofoppressing women and many if not most male christians are still unable tolive in a nonsexist manner  the idea that god is sexless or that christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission is met with a greatdeal of resistance  this insistance on a maledominated theology and the maledominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who havehad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches  second paganism respects the physical world  this is an idea with greatramifications  one of these is environmentalismrespect for our surroundingsand our world  another is integration of sexuality  christianity has a longtradition of calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppressand deny their sexuality  this is too muchsex is clearly a part of humanexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option  christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic and paganismis an attractive option  im not advocating that christian doctrines no sex before marriage etcshould be changedjust that christians work toward a more moderate ethic ofsexuality  denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderatedsexuality and neither one does much to bring us closer to god,15,christian

magi  scholars say many key beliefs of christiansjews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster thezoroastrian prophet   yet with only about 150000 zoroastrians in the entire world they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live  survival as apeople is very much on their minds   ironically local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited toleranceof the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followedby nearly 1000 years of benign religious segregation could not do causetheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians   zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion and theyactually shun the notion of trying to win converts  so if their childrenbecome totally assimilated they say its their children  rather thanthe world at large  who will be the losers   its important to have an identity said maneck bhujwaia of san josea leader among zoroastrians who came here from india  its importantfor everybody  irish scottish americans  it gives meaning to lifeyou dont have to depend on the majority community to give you respectyou can fall back on your own identity   for zoroastrians theres much to be proud of   their prophet zoroaster seeking to make sense of a culture in whichanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common preached that there wasonly one god a good one  zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda whichtranslates as lord of wisdom and light_good vs evil_   zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil withthe good eventually winning  men and women could join in the battle forgood he said and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequencessuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong  he preached honesty charitykindness to animals respect for the environment hard work equality ofmen and women  basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions   but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not tofollow him blindly  he demanded they think for themselves  in factjoseph campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of mythstraced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians   zoroastrians have many words for thought  their motto leaded into astained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes ofmount hamilton is good thoughts good words good deeds   so its not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly  in indiawhere a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escapepersecution by muslims in iran zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacythe overall statistic in india is just 60 percent   about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from indiaand pakistan mostly to study at universities  the other half fled fromiran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic statewhere others had no rights   local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on gooddeeds has improved life in every country they inhabit  in san josethe recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about becausemanou mobedshahi a san franciscobased hotelier passed the boardedupdowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple  at the templesdedication the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta thezoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra   the temple exists because of another good deed the decision by aniranian emigre the late arbab rustom guiv to buy land for six templesin north america  besides the 10acre site off crothers road on mounthamilton he paid for land in los angeles chicago new york torontoand vancouver  until his gifts there were no zoroastrian temples onthis continent   local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple and theproperty already had a large house that they have converted to acommunity center   the temple dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster is a simple structure with gleaming white walls vaulted ceilings and oak floors partially covered with huge oriental carpets   its central feature is the fire set in the middle of a partlyglassedin area at the center of the building  although zoroastrians are sometimes called fire worshippers they actually consider fire just a symbol of god  it helps us concentrate just like christians use the cross and muslims use the holy book bhujwala said   the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring  for alliranians including zoroastrians the new year begins on the first day ofthe season because of its symbolism as the start of

note that i said the fall of rome not of the empire  the roman empirelasted until 1453 with its transfered capital in constantinople  themain reason for its fall was not so much the sack of constantinople bythe men of the 4th crusade who were not christians  they had beenexcommunicated down to the last man after attacking the christian cityof zara in croatia but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle ofmazinkert  after the turks breached the frontier it was only a matterof time before the empire fell the inability of the empire to hold ontothe rim of anatolia with the ottomans and rum seljuks in the middleshould be quite obvious to any student of history  the sack ofconstantinople only hastened the inevitable along  for if the greekshad wanted to save their empire why would they not cooperate with thecrusaders when they came to do battle with the saracens in the 1st3rdcrusades  because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people theyconsidered heretics even though those heretics were fighting for thecause of the empire and christendom in doing battle with the turkishhordes in anatolia edessa lebanon palastine and syria the somehordes who were to later sack constantinople and overrun a third ofeurope the balkans hungary the ukraine the caucasus etc,15,christian

there has been a lot of discussion about tyre  in sum ezekiel prophesiedthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt as there are a lot ofpeople living there it would appear that ezekiel was not literally correctthis doesnt bother me at all because i understand the language ezekiel useddifferently than do socalled biblical literalists  for example it sometimeshappens that someone says my grandson is the cutest baby and then turnsaround and sees the granddaughter and says oh  isnt she the cutest thingthis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in theworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied forfirst  rather he is trying to express his emotions using words that are veryobjectoriented  because this example is one that is common to many peoplenobody misunderstands the intent of the statements the bible however isoften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactlyliterally true  for those people the existence of tyre is a problem for meit is notturning to the latest person trying to defend ezekiel we read this fromjohn e kingno it implies nothing of the kind  if you had nothing but the prophecy fromezekiel and you were told you interpret it literally you would never sayoh he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stufflike that  you would read i will make you a bare rock and you will neverbe rebuilt and youd conclude that tyre would be a bare rock  the only wayto get from fishing nets to houses and buildings and a mediumlargepopulation is if you know that all that latter stuff is therein other words your answer means that ezekiel misled everybody who read theprophecy at the time it was written  there is no way that given a literalreading they could read this passage and conclude mediumsize cityyou seem to feel that never be rebuilt means be rebuilt  maybe so butit is hardly a clear implicationwell no  thats only a bit less than the population of annapolis where imfrom  you know the naval acadamy the state capital george washingtonresigned his commission in the statehouse  annapolis may not be new york butits at least a twohorse townbut supposing 22000 people is a small town  its still 22000 peoplemore than ezekiel predictedand youve said nothing about the other problem  in chapter 26 ezekielpredicts that nebuchadnezzar will will destroy tyre and loot all theirvaluables  however nebuchadnezzar did not destroy tyre and in chapter 29ezekiel even quotes god as saying he and his army got no reward from thecampaign he led against tyrelets ignore alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter 26ezekiel says n would destroy tyre and n did not destroy tyre  ezekiel saysthat n would plunder their valuables but n did not plunder their valuablesregardless of what you think about tyre _now_ the fact is that n died beforethe place was destroyed  ezekiel said n was going to do it and n did not this post is of course pointless  inerrantists have an amazing abilityto rewrite the bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to sayfor example i expect mr king to respond to the comments about ezekiel 26by pulling some clear implications out of hatwhen ezekiel said that n would demolish your towers that clearly impliedthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towersused to be  and when ezekiel said that n would demolish your fine housesand throw your stones timber and rubble into the sea that clearly impliedthat n would never set foot on the island  and when ezekiel wrote that nwould build a ramp up to your walls that clearly implies that n wouldspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to thewallssee  a few clear implications that are totally contrary to the text andyou can reconcile anything you want,19,misc

larry l overacker writes responding to simon   i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the   net  my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in   schism or legitimately excommunicated  but thats really beside   the point  what does the roman catholic church say   excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as   provided for in canon lawheres some of the theology involved for the interestedthere is confusion over this issue of the sspxs schism often thebasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schismtake the various classifications of obedience first  there are 2important elements involved here for my purposes1 a command2 the response made to the commandas far as the command goes commands can be legitimate such as thepope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays  or they can beillegitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the goddagon when every other full moon comes aroundas far as the response to a command goes it can be to refuse to dowhat is commanded or to complymaking a table there are thus 4 possibilitescommand         response            namelegitimate      comply              true obedienceillegitimate    refuse              true obediencelegitimate      refuse              disobedienceillegitimate    comply              false obedienceso now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come fromobedience is not solely a matter of compliancerefusal  the nature ofthe commands must also be taken into account it is not enough toconsider someones compliance or refusal and then say whether they areobedient or disobedient  you also have to take into considerationwhether the commands are good or badin my example if the pope commands all catholics to worship the goddagon and they all refuse they arent being disobedient at allas far as the society of saint pius x goes they are certainlyrefusing to comply with certain things the pope desires  but thatalone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient  youalso have to consider the nature of the papal desiresand theres the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have beencommanding certain very bad things for the church  the popes have ofcourse disagreedso where are we  are we in another arian heresy complete with weakpopes  or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers  well the onlyway to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what thetraditional teaching of the church isthe problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea ofwhat is really going on and what the issues are  the religion ofamerican catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth  youwill never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic pressin this country  on the other hand one italian catholic magazine iget  30 days  has had interviews with the superior general of thesociety of saint pius xmany catholics will decide to side with the pope  there is somesoundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventuallysome pope will straighten all this out  but on the other handthere is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term thepopes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing tohelp the situation by obeying them where theyre wrong  in fact ifthe situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him  at the veryleast theyre wasting a great opportunity because they are failingto love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs thisbadlyschism lets move on to schism  what is itschism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimatecommand  all schismatics are disobedient  but its a superset soit doesnt work the other way around not all disobeyers areschismatics  the mere fact that the sspx priests dont comply withthe holy fathers desires doesnt make them schismaticsso what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute aschism  maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismaticsyou must add this the rejection of the right to command  look in anydecent reference on catholic theology and thats what youll findthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right tocommandheres what the catholic encyclopedia says for example     not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands    of superiors denial of their divine right to command    from the ce article schismis the society of saint pius x then schismatic  the answer is a clearno they say that the pope is their boss  they pray for him everyday  and thats all that matters as far as schism goeswhat all this boils down to is this if we leave aside theconsideration of the exact nature of their objections their positionis a legitimate one as far as the catholic theology of obedience andschism goes  they are resisting certain papal policies because theythink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching ofthe papacy and the best interests of the church  in fact someonewho finds himself in this situation has a duty to resistnow what is the stance of rome on all this  well if you read theholy fathers motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out  its thedefinitive document on the subject  a motu proprio is a specificallypapal act  its not the product of a roman congregation a letterthat the pope has possibly never even read  its from the popehimself  his boss is god theres no one else to complain toin this document the holy father says among other things1 the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvreconstituted a schismatic act2 archbishop lefebvres problem was a misunderstanding of the natureof tradtionboth are confusing i fail to see the logic of the popes pointsas far as the episcopal consecrations go i read an interestingarticle in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no  itall gets back to the question of jurisdiction  if episcopalconsecrations imply rejection of the popes jurisdiction then theywould truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunicationunder the current code of canon law  but my problem with this isthis according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopalconsecration does not confer jurisdiction  it only confers the powerof order the ability to confect the sacraments  jurisdiction must beconferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as thepope  the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quitewell take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction overanyone  they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishopthe si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that thereason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novelpostvatican ii idea of holy orders  according to this ideaepiscopal consecration does confer jurisdiction  i lent the articleto a friend unfortunately so cant tell you more  i believe theyquoted the new code of canon law in support of this ideathe popes thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to metheres no way there is a schism according to traditional catholictheology  so why does the pope think thisas far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes heresthe passage in question    the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete    and contradictory notion of tradtion  incomplete because it does    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of    tradition which as the second vatican council clearly taught        comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the        help of the holy spirit  there is a growth in insight into        the realities and words that are being passed on  this comes        about in various ways  it comes through the contemplation and        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts        it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which        they experience  and it comes from the preaching of those who        have received along with their right of succession in the        espiscopate the sure charism of truth    but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which    opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the    bishop of rome and the body of bishops  it is impossible to    remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond    with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church    papal motu proprio ecclesia dei 2 july 1988it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that canbe simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened i am the popethe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove thatarchbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with themthis is weak to say the leastit would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressedarchbishop lefebvres concerns in detail  what is john paul iisstand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregory xvi piusix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example  are we supposed toignore what all these popes said on the subjecti dont know what the future will hold but the powers that be in thesspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things outmany people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obeyjustified disobedience or even obeying god rather than mancalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice inwonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to meansimilarly schism indicates a formal break in the church  if the popesays that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition itexists  it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the breakthat there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it willshortly be healed  but how can one deny that it does in fact existit seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thingyou are trying to reform the power of the papacy  what good will itdo you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future but inthe process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of churchdiscipline  its one thing to hold that the pope has misused hispowers and excommunicated someone wrongly  its something else tosay that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism isall in his imagination  that means that acts of church discipline arenot legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate  generallyit has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the popewhile they have often objected to church sanctions generally theyhave admitted that the sanctions exist  you are now opening the doorto people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be trulyobeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicatedthis would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to commandthat you say defines schism,15,christian

predecessors over the last several centuries couldpersuade christian b of my case that the inquisition does indeedconstitute an egregious violation of the law of love  i must also notethat the majority of christians have been so persuaded  by christianargumentation as well as by secular both christian and nonchristianprohibitionswhat mr turpin alludes to is a trickier point	a  i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved	    in the inquisition	b  the inquisitor responds that mother church must however	    painful this seems discipline her children for their	    own good  in this case the salvation of their souls or	    if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example	    deterring others from the same lossofsoul	a  i point out that this justification of a failure in love	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable	b  burns me at the stakemy rhetoric has failed but the point i am making is sustained  what isgoing on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage  in this casethe baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular beliefthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is mostbelievable if taken under torture  the elimination of inqisitorialpractice in those places where it has been eliminated or at leastgreatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussionof sin in the exchange between a and bmr turpin is pointing out that if i am a versus the grand inquisitors bthen my persuasion is not very likely to work  i know this and in whatever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defenseattorney  so one possibility fails in this case  as it will fail inmay others  at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when itproperly should not if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with theinquisitor  and that is potentially an even more troubling case in thatmany of the victims of inquisition will have accepted that they were infact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guiltyof charges brought against themthe point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do notshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage  and given the mainthrust of the inquisition against heresy it is bound to break downin precisely the worst cases  the conservative i dont think thatis the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b abovethat he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works toa greater good  but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to followthe gospel as if ones theories about sin entitled one to cast asidejesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew 539ffi am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriouslywell the whole point of making these the base commandments is thatthey arent reducible to rules  a set of rules is a moral code or alaw code or an algorithm for acting  such things can be very helpfulto individuals or societies  but not if they are used instead of apersonal involvement in and responsibility for ones actions  the greatcommandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you weregod and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action  ademand that i like most would rather not hear but it keeps poppingup nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more importantthat i be open to trying this than succeeding at it  conservativesmay twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for otherpeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they dont keep your rulesthey are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced alot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocyis how god acts  that after all is the standard accusation againstgod by the atheists here and elsewhere  that the conservatives haveconfused their manipulative hoopjumping notions of coercing otherpeople with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standardamerican atheism  and i quite agree with it on this pointand different bodies of christians have from the beginning urgeddifferent ethical systems or in some cases none  as a resultit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popularor infamous with christianity  christianity does not have a torahit does not have a quran  specifically christian scripture has verylittle if anything in the way of commandments  so little thatthe christians who desperately want commandments go mining forthem with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts  the one single thing in the gospels which jesusspecifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another	i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson	 that i hope to get to in a day or so  it is quite true that	 some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt ill	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why	 there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involvedyou are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethicalsystembut why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since oursociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do  itmay be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once againi think you are begging the question why dont i and the myriadsof other christians like me tell you something about christianitynor is this very new in christianity  you might want to look upthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers from the 17thcentury onwards and they are not at all the first to understand thegospel in a manner that is congenial to my case,19,misc
well despite what my mother told me about accepting dares here goes you have to be very careful about what you mean by question authoritytaken literally it is nonsense that which is authoratative is authoratativeand to say i question to word of this authority is ridiculous if it is open to question it isnt an authority on the other hand it is perfectlyreasonable to question whether something is an authority the catch phrasehere should be authenticate authority once you have authenticatedyour authority you must believe what it says or you are not treating it asan authority the difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy you can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistencyin what it teaches or by showing that it does not obey its own rules ofdiscourse but the fact that i cannot discredit something does not ininself accredit it nor does the fact that i can convince myself and other that i have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is falsei cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings because if i can independantly verify its teachings i dont need an authority i need an authority only when there is information i need whichi cannot get for myself thus if i am to authenticate an authority i mustdo it by some means other than by examining its teachings in practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we donthave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves every scientistworing today assumes on the authority of the scintific community all sortsof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himselfin spiritual matters we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation we select our authorities based on various criteria i ama catholic in part because the historical claims of the rc church seemthe strongest without authorities there would be no subject matter forbelief unless we simply made something up for ourselves as many dothe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities this is areasonable assertion in itself but it leads to a practical difficultyif you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility ofevery receiving information thus the atheist position can never possiblychange it is nonfalsifiable and therefore unscintific to demand scintific or rational proof of gods existence is to denygods existence since neither science nor reason can in their verynature prove anything,15,christian

i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract it is abit lengthy for a posting but i thought id share it with all of youanyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel mightbenefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it                     d o e s  g o d  l o v e  y o u   q what  kind  of  question  is that   anyone who can read sees signs   tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you  isnt   that true a it  is  true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read   in one of the most quoted verses in the bible       for  god  so  loved  the world that he gave his only begotten      son that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish  but      have everlasting life                               john 316        the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord  but he      loveth him that followeth after righteousness   proverbs 159       for  the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of      the ungodly shall perish                            psalm 16  q but  i am not wicked  i am a decent moral person  surely the good   i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done   how   can these verses apply to me a by  gods  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is   looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to  hell    the   bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven   on  the  contrary  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before   god       as it is written there is none righteous no not one  there      is  none  that understandeth there is none that seeketh after      god                                            romans 31011       the  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things and desperately      wicked who can know it                         jeremiah 179  q if i am such a wicked person in gods sight what will god do to me a the  bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will   come under eternal punishment in a place called hell       for  a  fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the      lowest hell and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains  i will heap      mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them  they      shall  be  burnt  with hunger and devoured with burning heat      and  with  bitter  destruction  i will also send the teeth of      beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust                                                deuteronomy 322224  q oh  come  on now   hell is not real is it  surely things are not   that bad a indeed  hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ   ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior    the  bible   makes  many  references  to hell indicating that it is both eternal   and consists of perpetual suffering       and  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was      cast into the lake of fire                   revelation 2015       so  shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come      forth and sever the wicked from among  the  just  and  shall      cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and      gnashing of teeth                            matthew 134950           when  the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with      his mighty angels in flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them      that  know  not  god and that obey not the gospel of our lord      jesus   christ    who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting      destruction  from the presence of the lord and from the glory      of his power                            2 thessalonians 179  q that is terrible  why would god create a hell a hell  is  terrible  and  it  exists  because  god created man to be   accountable to god for his actions  gods perfect  justice  demands   payment for sin       for the wages of sin is death                     romans 623       for  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of christ      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body      according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad                                                  2 corinthians 510       but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment                                                       matthew 1236  q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed  it  does  that  is  unless  we  can find someone to be our   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our   sins    that  someone  is  god  himself who came to earth as jesus   christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him       all  we  like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one      to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity  of      us all                                            isaiah 536       but  he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for      our iniquities the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him      and with his stripes we are healed                isaiah 535       for  i  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which i also      received how that christ died for our sins according  to  the      scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the      third day according to the scriptures    1 corinthians 1534       for  he  hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that      we might be made the righteousness of god in him                                                  2 corinthians 521  q are  you  saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was   already punished for my sins then i will not have  to  worry  about   hell anymore a yes this is so  if i have believed in christ as my savior then it   is  as  if  i  have already stood before the judgment throne of god   christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins       he  that  believeth  on  the son hath everlasting life and he      that believeth not the son shall not see life but  the  wrath      of god abideth on him                               john 336  q but  what  does it mean to believe on him  if i agree with all that   the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to   hell a believing  on  christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our   minds with the truths of the bible  it means that we hang our whole   lives  on him   it means that we entrust every part of our lives to   the  truths  of the bible  it means that we turn away from our sins   and serve christ as our lord       no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one      and  love  the  other  or  else  he will hold to the one and      despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon                                                        matthew 624       repent  ye  therefore and be converted that your sins may be      blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from  the      presence of the lord                                acts 319  q are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape hell except   through jesus   what about all the other  religions    will  their   followers also go to hell a yes indeed  they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account   able  for  our  sins   god demands that we pay for our sins  other   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their   followers  christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and   save us       neither  is  there  salvation  in any other for there is none      other name under heaven given among men whereby  we  must  be      saved                                               acts 412        i  am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the      father but by me                                   john 146       if  we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us      our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness                                                          1 john 19  q now i am desperate  i do not want to go to hell  what can i do a you  must  remember  that god is the only one who can help you  you   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god   as  you  see   your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you       and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much      as  his  eyes  unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying      god be merciful to me a sinner                     luke 1813         sirs what must i do to be saved  and they said believe      on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved                                                        acts 163031  q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully  god  not  only saves us through the lord jesus but he   also gives us the faith to believe on him  you can pray to god that   he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior       for  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith and that not of      yourselves it is the gift of god               ephesians 28    god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith  so   if  you  really  mean  business  with  god about your salvation you   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is   the only word of god   in  this  brochure  all  verses  from the bible are within indented   paragraphs  give heed to them with all your heart       so  then  faith  cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of      god                                              romans 1017  q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes    god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging   our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him       the  sacrifices  of  god  are  a broken spirit a broken and a      contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise      psalm 5117    because  we  are sinners we love our sins  therefore we must begin   to pray to god for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins    and  if  we   sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins   as  god  strengthens  us    we know that our sins are sending us to   hell       unto  you  first god having raised up his son jesus sent him      to bless you in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his      iniquities                                          acts 326  q doesnt  the  bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be   baptized  will these save me a if  possible  we should do these things but they will not save us   no work of any kind can secure our salvation   salvation  is  gods   sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas   ure  salvation is       not of works lest any man should boast         ephesians 29  q what else will happen at the end of the world a those  who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ  forever   more       for  the  lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout      with the voice of the archangel and with the  trump  of  god      and  the  dead  in christ shall rise first  then we which are      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the      clouds  to meet the lord in the air  and so shall we ever be      with the lord                         1 thessalonians 41617  q what will happen to the earth at that time a god  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens   and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers  forever   more       but  the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise  and      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up          nevertheless  we  according  to  his  promise  look  for new      heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness                                                     2 peter 31013  q does  the  bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will   come a yes    the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to   save       and  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the      world for a witness unto all nations and then shall  the  end      come                                            matthew 2414  q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes   god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing   of the history of the world and tells us that while the day  of  the   lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not   come  as  a  thief for the believers  there is much evidence in the   bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of christ may be   very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this       for  when  they  shall  say  peace  and  safety  then sudden      destruction cometh upon them as travail  upon  a  woman  with      child and they shall not escape          1 thessalonians 53       surely  the  lord  god  will  do nothing but he revealeth his      secret unto his servants the prophets                amos 37  q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes  it  does    god  warned  ancient nineveh that he was going to   destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning       and jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he      cried  and  said  yet  forty  days  and  nineveh  shall  be      overthrown                                          jonah 34  q what did the people of nineveh do a from  the  king on down they humbled themselves before god repented   of their sins and cried to god for mercy       but  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth and cry      mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his  evil      way  and  from  the violence that is in their hands  who can      tell  if  god  will  turn  and  repent and turn away from his      fierce anger that we perish not                  jonah 389  q did god hear their prayers a yes  god saved a great many people of nineveh  q can  i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg   ment a yes   there is still time to become saved even though that time has   become very short       how  shall  we escape if we neglect so great salvation which      at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed      unto us by them that heard him                    hebrews 23       in  god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength      and my refuge is in god   trust in  him  at  all  times  ye      people  pour  out  your heart

 i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged couple become married in gods eyes  some say that if the two have publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to god and are unswervingly committed to one another i realize this is a subjective qualifier they are marriedjoined in gods sightthe way i read scripture a couple becomes married when they are physicallymarried ie when they first have sexual intercourseeg the end of genesis 2 quoted from memory for this reason a man shallleave his parents and be joined to his wife and they will become one fleshjesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriageif you read through genesis in particular you will often come across thephraseology man lay with woman and she became his wife thisimplies that she became his wife when they lay together ie at thepoint of intercoursecompare this with jewish tradition joseph when he heard that marywas pregnant had it in mind to divorce her quietly  but mary and joseph werebetrothed not married ie they were in a binding relationship whichrequired a divorce to get out of but marriage would not occur until maryand joseph went to bed togethercompare with christ and the church ephesians 5 revelation 19 the church isdescribed as the bride of christ but the marriage of the lamb takes place when jesus returns ie we are in a binding loverelationship withjesus but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage willtake place i see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercoursebecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and godin summary engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship but it isnot marriage a civil ceremony is not marriage either marriage occurs at thepoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together i dont mean to demean thecivil or church ceremony  ours was great i dont mean to be too pedantichistorically i think i am correct in stating that the civil ceremony ie amarriage recognised by the state has only been around in the west sincenapoleon who introduced it to keep tabs on the people although im ready to becorrected on that pointthis view obviously raises some questionswhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners without consideringmarriage are those people also marriedif it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse is it necessaryto be married in the eyes of the state i would say yes because this honoursthe laws of our nations in the west although it is not illegal to sleeptogether though unmarried in most western countries i believe that it is godhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends beforeactually consummating our marriage its to do with our being salt and light andalso to do with how people will perceive us ie it is culturally insensitiveto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony michael davis cs89mcdbrunelacuk,15,christian
rick anderson replied to my letter withra in article rara      well jason its heretical in a few ways the first point is thatra      this equates lucifer and jesus as being the same type of beingra      however lucifer is a created being thou wast perfect in thyra      ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found inra      thee ezekiel 2815 while jesus is uncreated and the creator ofra      all things in the beginning was the word and the word was withra      god and the word was god  the same was in the beginning with godra      all things were made by him and without him was not any thing madera      that was made john 113 and he is before all things and byra      him all things consist colossians 117rara    your inference from the ezekiel and john passages that lucifer wasra created and that jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation ofra the word create  one with which many christians may not agreera granted the mormon belief that all of gods children including christra and lucifer are eternally existent intelligences which were organizedra into spirit children by god the term creation can apply equally wellra to both of those passages     just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to     differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may     not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith     on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is     truth regardless of popularity of opinions     also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created     and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon     belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to     have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address     and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the     conclusion that you grant     the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus     is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds     belief is that jesus and lucifer were the samera      your point that we all are brothers of jesus and lucifer is alsora      heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of christra      we are adopted for ye have not received the spirit of bondagera      again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption wherebyra      we cry abba father romans 815 and not the natural childrenra      of god it is only through faith that we even enter the family ofra      god for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesusra      galatians 326 and it is only through the manifestation of thisra      faith in receiving jesus that we are become the sons of god  butra      as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons ofra      god even to them that believe on his name which were born notra      of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man butra      of god john 11213rara    has it occured to you robert that being born of someone or beingra of that person or persons family may be a symbolic term in the newra testament  mormons believe that we are adopted into the house ofra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have expressedra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies     the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is     nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible     says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god          the field is the world the good seed are the children of the           kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one          matthew 1338          i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which           ye have seen with your father john 838          ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not           born of fornication we have one father even god  jesus said           unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i           proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he           sent me  why do ye not understand my speech even because ye           cannot hear my word  ye are of your father the devil and the           lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the           beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in           him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a           liar and the father of it john 84144          and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of           the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease           to pervert the right ways of the lord acts 1310          wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of

as many as received him to them gave he power to become the          sons of god even to them that believe on his name john 112          behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that          we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us          not because it knew him not  beloved now are we the sons of god          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when          he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he          is 1 john 312     when he is born again through faith in jesus christ          which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of          the will of man but of god john 113          having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus          christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will          ephesians 15          of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures james 118          for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of          god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear          but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba          father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we          are the children of god romans 81416          beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one          that loveth is born of god and knoweth god 1 john 47          whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is          begotten of him 1 john 51          for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus          galatians 326ra      we are told that and this is life eternal that they might knowra      thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sentra      john 173 life eternal is to know the only true god yet thera      doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastlyra      different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus ofra      the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaimra      one as being true denies the other from being true according to thera      bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god andra      not the construct of imaginationrarara    robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter ofra correct biblical interpretation  i dont mean to be snotty about thisra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by differentra groups of biblical scholars what do you think of the jehovahsra witnesses for example that to make reference to the jesus of thera bible is simply ridiculous  whose jesus of the bible do you mean     this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but      rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read      something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teaches for      example the fact that the jehovahs witnesses deny the deity of christ      does not alter what the bible teaches  looking for that blessed hope     and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus     christ titus 213simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus     christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through     the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ 2 peter 11      on the deity of christ     we first look to the bible to see what it teaches to discount or not      even address what the bible teaches because there are some groups that      have differing views is selfdefeating to see what the bible teaches      you have to look at the biblera      our lords mortality was essential to his own salvation _thera      promised messiah_ p 456 he had to work out his own salvation byra      doing the will of the father in all things ibid p54 he hadra      to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom _mormonra      doctrine_ p71rara    welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert  thera above books are by the late bruce r mcconkie a former general authorityra of the lds church  those books were not published by the church nor dora they constitute offical doctrine  they consist of his opinions  nowra does that mean that what he says is not true  not at all ill have tora think about the idea of christs personal salvation before i come to anyra conclusions myself  the conclusions i come to may seem heretical tora you but im prepared to accept that     i find this rather curious when i mentioned that the mormon belief is     that jesus needed to be saved i put forward some quotes from the late     apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the     issue of jesus needing to be saved rick comes the closest with his i     have my own conclusions to addressing the point     most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of     bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont     think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the     issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this     subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may      certainly be,19,misc

i agree with what darren has to say here but would like to add a personal observation  what i see as arrogance and the problem i have with it is not a sense of personal certainty but a lack of respect forothers who come to differing conclusions  clearly this is not just christian vs nonchristian there is a whole spectrum of belief systemswithin christianity  i do not tend to argue with others about mattersof personal faith because like aesthetics it is not demonstable byobjective means  choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty  what bothers me is when others suggest that in these matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others  it follows from thisthat god must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosingthe wrong path  this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for thehonest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and godeven a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others  it isuniversalizing those matters of personal faith coupled by a proudnotion that ones relationship with god is superior to others thatleads to arrogance  in my honest and nonuniversal opinion comments criticism welcomekenalvinucsucoloradoedu,15,christian

  this is a good point but i think average people do not take up christianity  so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their  social life or to get more involved with american culture if they are kids of  immigrants for example  since it is the overwhelming major religion in the  western world in some form or other it is simply the choice people take if  they are bored and want to do something new with their lives but not somethong  too new or too out of the ordinary  seems a little weak but as long as it  doesnt hurt anybody the social pressure is indeed a very important factor for the majority of passive christians in our world today in the case of early christianity the promise of a heavenly afterlife independent of your social status was also a very promising gift reason slaves and nonromans accepted the religion very rapidlyif this is a hypothetical proposition you should say so if itsfact you should cite your sources if all this is the amateursociologist subbranch of aa however it would suffice to alert theunwary that you are just screwing around ,0,atheism

for several years ive periodically asked charley wingate to explain thismythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiasticallywhen he pops up every few months  his reluctance to explain indicates to methat its not so hotive said enough times that there is no alternative that should think youmight have caught on by now  and there is no alternative but the pointis rationality isnt an alternative either  the problems of metaphysicaland religious knowledge are unsolvable or i should say humans cannotsolve themif there is truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoeverfor your claim  the usual line here which you call a prejudgment ofatheism and dispute is that reason is all we have  here you admitthat you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim thatthere is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable inreligious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts withreligious knowledgethis sounds very much like i cant provide a rational defense for mybelief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that itmay be false  i hope it makes you happy but your repeated andunfounded assertions to this effect dont advance your cause,0,atheism

id like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance ofchristians and look forward to any responses  in myencounters with christians i find myself dismayed by theirbelief that their faith is total truth  according to themtheir beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word ofgod and god is truth  thus they know the truth  this stancemakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my ownhesitations about christianity because they see no other waytheir way is the truthbut i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believea particular way  that choice is part faith and part reasonbut it seems to me a choicemy discussions with some christians remind me of schoolyarddiscussions when i was in grade schoola kid would say all policemen are jerks  id ask how doyou know  because my daddy told me so  how do you knowyoure daddy is right  he says hes always rightwell the argument usually stops right there  in the endarent we all just kids groping for the truth  if so do we havethe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own asfalsethis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup  iapologize if im covering tired old ground  some of thediscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and i welcomeany comments im sort of mystified about how a christian might respond to this  ican understand criticisms of christianity that say theres not enoughevidence to believe it or that theres just as good evidence forother religions  i dont agree but clearly there are plenty ofintelligent people who dont find the evidence convincing  but thatdoesnt seem to be your point  rather you seem upset that people whobelieve christianity is true also believe that things which contradictit are falsethis suggests a model of spiritual things thats rather different thanthe christian one  it sounds more like an existentialist view wherepeople choose what value to follow but theres no actual independentspiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is insome unique sense right  this sort of model  with modifications ofone sort or another  may be appropriate for some religions  butchristianity is in its essense a historical religion  that is itsbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities outthere that one of them has intervened in history in specific waysand that we see evidence of that in history  in the mundane worldwe are not free to choose how things work  when we drop something itfalls aside from welldefined situations where it doesnt  thechristian concept is that spiritual matters there is also an actualexternal reality  i hope were all honest enough not to claim that wehave perfect understanding  but while we may not think we knoweverything we are confident that we know some things  and thatimplies that we think things that contradict them are false  i dontsee how else we could proceedthis neednt result in arrogance  im certainly interested in talkingwith people of other religions  they may have things to teach me andeven if they dont i respect them as fellow human beings  but itsgot to be possible to respect people and also think that on somematters they are wrong  maybe even disasterously wrong,15,christian

one rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim they arewrong  i was just reading john 14 this morning i think that is theright chapter anyway it is close and i dont have a bible at work tocheck with and in it jesus is talking to his disciples about hisimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then laterhe will be with them  he said something along the lines of i willbe in you and you will be in me  again i cannot provide the exactquote or citation  anyway my understanding of this is thatthe second coming will not be an outward event  it is an inwardevent christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in himif you look for a person you will be deceivedit seems to me that the jews had been looking for a messiah that wouldbe a political or military leader and so didnt recognize jesus whenhe came  jesus tried to show that his kingdom was not of this eartha lot of what i have seen written about the second coming seems tobased on an expectation of christ coming back and finally taking overthe world and running it the way it should be  it sounds a lot likewhat the jews were looking for  the first coming wasnt like that andi see no reason for the second coming to be like that eitheroh and by the way i dont expect it to happen once  there is no onesecond coming there are a lot of little ones  every time christcomes into someones heart christ has come againpeacewill ,15,christian
  the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime  but the legal  shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court  battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what  it should be  hence the question is  do we instate the death penalty as  it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of  it entirely  i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a deterrent to crime if sowhy doesnt every crime carry a death penalty  that would be effictivewouldnt it   the death penalty is a punishment much like a 50 fine for speeding isa punishment anyway somebody with murder on the mind doesnt much careabout the consequences i think another problem is that people dont thinkthey will get caught if i wanted to kill another person i wouldnt care what the penalty was if i didnt think i would get caught  if it was to be strictly a deterrent it should have been more along the lines of torture,0,atheism

to recapitulate a bit the essence of marriage is two peoples commitment to each other if two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not  willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state thats  prima facie evidence that the commitment isnt really there there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible  without a civil or church wedding if youre stranded on a desert  island or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason  eg laws against interracial marriage the legal concept of commonlaw marriage is meant to ensure that  the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the  usual ceremony and recordkeeping pastorally im concerned that people should not use being married  in gods eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding  one has a duty to have ones marriage properly recorded and witnessed   but there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony  without making a genuine commitment and therefore are not married  in gods eyes  right   michael a covington associate research scientist              artificial intelligence programs      mcovingtaiugaedu     the university of georgia              phone 706 5420358          athens georgia 306027415 usa     amateur radio n4tmi       ,15,christian

someone sent me this faq by email and i post my response hereim not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because mostof our readers probably havent seen it  clhchrist warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of thesecommandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least inthe kingdom of heaven matt 519  this faq is so full of error that imust respond to it  i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it thepartisan theology1  the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai  rom415 notes that where no law is there is no transgression  not onlydid sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before itwas revealed on sinai ex 162  the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promisewhich undergirded it  god wanted to perform his will in the lives of thepeople but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery they promisedwhat ever he says to do we will do  that is why the new covenant isbased on better promises heb 86  rather than do away with the lawgod promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on theirhearts heb 8103  including the sabbath in the acts 15 is selective inclusion  thesabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision  if any attempthad been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have beeneven more strident than is recorded in acts 15  do not confuse the weeklysabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur atany time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which wasadded because of transgression of the moral law gal 3194  israel stands for gods people of all time  that is why god graftedthe gentiles in  roma 94 says that the adoption the glory thecovenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promisesbelong to israelites   in explanation paul makes it clear that being borninto israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are ofisrael v 6  then in gal 319 he says if ye be christs then are yeabrahams seed and heirs according to the promise  all christians areabrahams seed jews israelites  not physically for that is not thecriterion but spiritually  we are joint heirs with jesus based on thepromise god made to all his people the israelitespeople would probably agree but they are wrong  how can the sabbathcommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates theceremonial laws  you are not free to choose your time of worship  evenif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagansun worship  would you rather give up a day which god blessedsanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leadersagree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions insocreligionchristianbiblestudyi do not care what calvin or any theologian says  my guide is what godsays  if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the lawwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is thesabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was importantenough to say remember  if you study the word deeply you will note thatthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law butfreed by the grace of god  if a cop pulls me over for speeding then incourt i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives megrace do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding for iam now under grace  being under grace i now drive within the speedlimit  paul adds to it in rom 331 di we then make void the law throughfaith  god forbid yea we establish the law  wherefore the law isholy and the commandment holy and just and good rom 712do you prefer implication to fact  a careful study of the acts 20 showsthat the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul didnot go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot toassos  in icor 16 there is no way you can equate lay by him in storewith go to a worship servicewrong  these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbathday of the moral lawwhy would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different argumentswhich conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from agod who loved you enough to die for you  jesus died because the law couldnot be changed  why bother to die in order to meet the demands of abroken law if all you need to do is change the law  penalties for lawbreaking means the law is immutable  that is why it is no sin not tofollow the demands of the ceremonial laws  it will always be a sin tomake false gods to violate gods name to break the sabbath to steal tokill etc  except it you disagree  but then your opinion has no weightwhen placed next to the word of goddariusits not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq  ithink pauls comments on esteeming one day over another rom 14 isprobably all that needs to be said  i accept that darius is doingwhat he does in honor of the lord  i just wish he might equallyaccept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doingtheir best to honor the lordhowever id like to be clear that i do not think theres unambiguousproof that regular christian worship was on the first day  as iindicated there are responses on both of the passages citedthe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actuallyabout something else  they both look like they are talking aboutnnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and theygathered every sunday for worship  we get various pieces ofinformation but nothing aimed at answering this question  act 226 describes christians as participating both in jewish templeworship and in christian communion services in homes  obviously thetemple worship is on the sabbath  acts 1344 is an example ofchristians participating in them  unfortunately it doesnt tell uswhat day christians met in their houses  acts 207 despite dariusconfusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday  i see noreason to impose modern definitions of when days start when thebiblical text is clear about what was meant  the wording implies tome that this was a normal meeting  it doesnt say they gathered tosee paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking breadpaul talked about his upcoming travel  but thats just not explicitenough to be really convincing  similarly with 1 cor 162  it saysthat on the first day they should set aside money for paulscollection  now if you want to believe that they gathered speciallyto do this or that they did it in their homes i cant disprove itbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would bewhen they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to doit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific dayso i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first dayof every week simply means every time they gather for worship  i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statementsis that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christianworship was,15,christian

it was a gift from god  i think basically the reasoning was that thetradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesusas the tenets of faith developed particularly with augustine sin wasmore and more equated with sex and thus mary was assumed to be a virginfor life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of god etcsince we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born witha predisposition to sin and since mary did not have this predispositionbecause she did not ever sin she didnt have original sin  when sciencediscovered the process of conception the next step was to assume thatmary was conceived without original sin the immaculate conceptionmary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes  she refered to herself as the immaculate conception  since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemedto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrinercs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources thatbeing sacred scripture and holy tradition  in this case mostly tradition,15,christian

listowner i have sent this to mr anderson privately post it onlyif you think it of general interesthere is a copy of something i wrote for another list you mayfind it relevanta listmember asks  what makes commonlaw marriages wronga commonlaw marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there isnothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married bya preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewishpriests have never had any connection with weddingsthere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by theclergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in thewest is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriageand that the clergyman is there only as a witnesshoweverthe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment twopersons are considered to be married if and only if they have boundthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wifeforsaking all others till death do them part      the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about whois married to whom have always insisted on some kind of publicceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may beclear about whether a commitment has been madesuppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vowsetc instead we have a man and a woman settling down to livetogether      after a year or so the man says to the woman hey honey itwas great while it lasted but i think its time to move onyoungerocean as eternal as the stars as long as i live i am yoursutterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeblebreath will utter your name myman is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of sillythings like that you mustnt take them literallyand that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that isa matter of public record      the church insists on it because it is her duty among otherthings to give moral advice and you cannot give a man moral adviceabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is marriedto whom if anybody and vice versa      the state insists on it since the state has a concern withproperty rights with child care and support and therefore needs toknow who has made what commitments to whom      prospective fathersinlaw insist on it because they dontwant their daughters seduced and abandoned      prospective spouses insist on it because they want to makesure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitmentor just poetry      and persons making vows themselves insist on making themformally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their ownminds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselvesthat this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing      hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of themarriage commitment  the church goes further and insists that whenchristians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding andrecord the vows on behalf of the church not because it isimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in orderto make sure that the couple understand what the christian teachingabout marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be marriedin a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriagevow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for muchthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when theydraw up a will or a contract certain language has been repeatedlyused in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret ittry to say the same thing in your own words and you may find thatthe probate judges interpretation of them is not at all what youintended  similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debatesabout whether you are my main squeeze and i am here for the longhaul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all othersand till death do us part      this topic has come up on the list before is there any topicthat hasnt one listmember was asking if a couple love eachother and are living together isnt that marriage in the eyes ofgod eventually someone asked in that case what is their statusif they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorceare they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walkof that in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting thatsomeone who says we dont need a piece of paper or a ceremony infront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love eachother is trying to have it both ways  to have the advantages ofmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum ofbotherat this point someone may say none of this applies to me and mymate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelongcommitment for better or worse forsaking all others till deathus do part so in our case no ceremony is needed     to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a driverslicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road  what is wrong initself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existenceof dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is anobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing thenumber of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightlymakes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positivemoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matterhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you

very interesting but i also believe that you have presented amisleading argument  christianity is not the cause of the massacresand horrific injustices that you relate rather they are the faultof people who misunderstand jesus christs message and modifyit to suit their own beliefs and aims rather than alter theirambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable inthe new testament  with every truthful and good message thatcarries authority or implied authority comes the inevitablefact that some many people will understand it in a distortedway with inevitable consequencesthe bibles message is that we are to love all people andthat all people are redeemable  it preaches a message ofrepentance and of giving  unfortunately all people havedeceitful hearts and are capable of turning this messagearound and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable waysthis is also a fundamental christian doctrineone of the problems is that you look at the world throughthe eyes of western history  i think that you will findmany many cases of massacres that were instigated bypeople who never claimed they were christian  i am not sayingthis to justify the massacres that were but i am merelypointing you to a tendency which is present in humans alreadyconsider the world without christianity  i doubt that wewould have the same freedoms in the countries in which welive if it wasnt for the peaceful doctrines of jesus christperhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religioni wont name any here though one comes to mind whichwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate suchsubjectspoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst forpower greed and hatred  please dont point the blame ata message which preaches fundamental giving and denial inlove for othersyours in christandrew mcveighps i believe that a line of questioning like you presentedis strangely enough compatible with becoming a christiancertainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviourof the world and especially christians  i praise god forjesus christ and the fact that we can doubt our beliefsand still come back to god and be forgiven time and timeagain,15,christian

blocks of a logical argument aproposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it israining or today is tuesday  propositions may be either asserted said tobe true or denied said to be false  note that this is a technical meaningof deny not the everyday meaningthe proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particulararrangement of words used to express it  so god exists and there exists agod both express the same propositionan argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series ofstatements to establish a definite proposition  an argument consists ofthree stagesfirst of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument tocontinue are stated  these are called the premises of the argument  theyare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as becausesince obviously and so on  the phrase obviously is often viewed withsuspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspiciouspremises  if something doesnt seem obvious to you dont be afraid toquestion it  you can always say oh yes youre right it is obvious whenyouve heard the explanationnext the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process knownas inference  in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis ofone or more other propositions already accepted  there are various forms ofvalid inferencethe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in furtherinference  inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that orthereforefinally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument  the proposition whichis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference  conclusions are oftenindicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we concludeand so on  the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inferencefor exampleevery event has a cause premisethe universe has a beginning premiseall beginnings involve an event premisethis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inferencetherefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusionnote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in anotherargument  a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion withrespect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolationsometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for examplethe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion  this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusingrecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises orconclusions  many people shower their writing with assertions without everproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument  somestatements look like arguments but are not  for exampleif the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of godthis is not an argument it is a conditional statement  it does not assertthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion  it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but wellcome to those lateranother examplegod created you therefore do your duty to godthe phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neithertrue nor false  therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not anargumentfinally causality is important  consider a statement of the form a becauseb  if were interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence thestatement is an argument  if were trying to establish the truth of b thenit is not an argument it is an explanationfor examplethere must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start  this is an argumentmy car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine  this is an explanationthere are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive  adeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion mustalso be true  a deductive argument is either valid or invalid  a validargument is defined as one where if the premises are true then theconclusion is truean inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for thetruth of the conclusion  inductive arguments are not valid or invalidhowever we can talk about whether they are better or worse than otherarguments and about how probable their premises arethere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductivenor inductive  however we will concentrate for the moment on deductivearguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincingit is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid doesnot imply that its conclusion holds  this is because of the slightly counterintuitive nature of implication which we must now consider morecarefullyobviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions  however anargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example   all insects have wings premise   woodlice are insects premise   therefore woodlice have wings conclusionhere the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false if the arguments premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely validmore subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premisesas in   all fish live in the sea premise   dolphins are fish premise   therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusionhowever the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through validinference from true premises  we can therefore draw up a truth table forimplicationthe symbol  denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectivelypremise conclusion inference   a        b        ab   f        f         t      if the premises are false and the inference   f        t         t      valid the conclusion can be true or false   t        f         f      if the premises are true and the conclusion                             false the inference must be invalid   t        t         t      if the premises are true and the inference valid                             the conclusion must be truea sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true  a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion  be careful not to confusevalid arguments with sound argumentsto delve further into the structure of logical arguments would requirelengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy  it is simpler and probablymore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructingan argument  these pitfalls are known as fallaciesin everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefsas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs  this is fairenough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form oftechnically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid orconvincingso for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logicalargument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrectwhen examined more closely  by studying fallacies we aim to avoid beingmisled by them  the following list of fallacies is not intended to beexhaustiveargumentum ad baculum appeal to forcethe appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or thethreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion  itis often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguerfor example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible  all those whorefuse to accept that truth will burn in hellargumentum ad hominemargumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the manthe abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of tryingto disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person orpeople making the assertion  this is invalid because the truth of anassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting itfor exampleatheism is an evil philosophy  it is practised by communists and murdererssometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer  this is a valid way ofreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and notargumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witnessstestimony is false  to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of theargumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this listthe circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a personargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because ofthe opponents particular circumstancesfor exampleit is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food  how can you argueotherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoesthis is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissingthe opponents argumentthis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion  for exampleof course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing youre whitethis particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that onesadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests isalso known as poisoning the wellargumentum ad ignorantiumargumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance  this fallacyoccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because ithas not been proved false  or equivalently when it is argued thatsomething must be false because it has not been proved true  note that thisis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been provedtrue a basic scientific principleexamplesof course the bible is true  nobody can prove otherwiseof course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist  nobody hasshown any proof that they are realnote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one isgenerally assumed innocent until proven guiltyalso in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would producecertain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur  for examplea flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of waterto be present on the earth  the earth does not have a tenth as much watereven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles  therefore nosuch flood occurredin science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something hasnot occurred  we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurredhoweverargumentum ad misericordiamthis is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading  the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted  for examplei did not murder my mother and father with an axe  please dont find meguilty im suffering enough through being an orphanargumentum ad populumthis is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people  tocommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion byappealing to a large group of people  this form of fallacy is oftencharacterized by emotive language  for examplepornography must be banned  it is violence against womenthe bible must be true  millions of people know that it is  are you tryingto tell them that they are all mistaken foolsargumentum ad numeramthis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum  it consists ofasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the morelikely it is that that proposition is correctargumentum ad verecundiamthe appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and winsupport for an assertion  for exampleisaac newton was a genius and he believed in godthis line of argument is not always completely bogus for example referenceto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to adiscussion of that subject  for example we can distinguish quite clearlybetweenstephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiationandjohn searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computerhawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on blackhole radiation to be informed  searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is wellqualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligencethe fallacy of accidentthe fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to aparticular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule isinapplicable  it is the error made when one goes from the general to thespecific  for examplechristians generally dislike atheists  you are a christian so you mustdislike atheiststhis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decideevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rulesconverse accident  hasty generalizationthis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident  it occurs when oneforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are notrepresentative of all possible casesfor examplejim bakker was an insincere christian  therefore all christians areinsinceresweeping generalization  dicto simplicitera sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to aparticular situation in which the features of that particular situationrender the rule inapplicable  a sweeping generalization is the opposite of ahasty generalizationnon causa pro causa  post hoc ergo propter hocthese are known as false cause fallaciesthe fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as thecause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause  for examplei took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared  so godcured me of the headachethe fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed tobe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event  for examplethe soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism  therefore we must avoidatheism for the same reasonscum hoc ergo propter hocthis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc  it asserts thatbecause two events occur together they must be causally related and leavesno room for other factors that may be the causes of the eventspetitio principiithis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as theconclusion reachedcirculus in demonstrandothis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which onewishes to reach  often the proposition will be rephrased so that thefallacy appears to be a valid argument  for examplehomosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office  hence anygovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be opento blackmail  therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold governmentofficenote that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion  an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reasonfor the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classicwe know that god exists because the bible tells us so  and we know that thebible is true because it is the word of godcomplex question  fallacy of interrogationthis is the fallacy of presupposition  one example is the classic loaded questionhave you stopped beating your wifethe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has noteven been asked  this trick is often used by lawyers in crossexaminationwhen they ask questions likewhere did you hide the money you stolesimilarly politicians often ask loaded questions such ashow long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continueordoes the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatizationignoratio elenchithe fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to dowith that conclusionfor example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that theteachings of christianity are undoubtably true  if he then argues at lengththat christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well heargues he will not have shown that christian teachings are truesadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouseemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a morefavourable lightequivocationequivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more differentmeanings in the same argument  for examplewhat could be more affordable than free software  but to make sure that itremains free that users can do what they like with it we must place alicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributableamphibolyamphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous becauseof careless or ungrammatical phrasingaccentaccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning  in this casethe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement areemphasized  for example considerwe should not speak ill of our friendsandwe should not speak ill of our friendsfallacies of compositionone fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the partsof something must apply to the whole  for examplethe bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweightthe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a numberof individual items is shared by a collection of those items  for examplea car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus  therefore carsare less environmentally damaging than busesfallacy of divisionthe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition  likeits opposite it exists in two varieties  the first is to assume that aproperty of some thing must apply to its parts  for exampleyou are studying at a rich college  therefore you must be richthe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared byeach item  for exampleants can destroy a tree  therefore this ant can destroy a treethe slippery slope argumentthis argument states that should one event occur so will other harmfulevents  there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by thefirst eventfor exampleif we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroinand well have a nation full of drugaddicts on welfare  therefore we cannotlegalize marijuanaa is based on b fallacies  is a type of fallaciesthese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some waysimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similarexamplesisnt history based upon faith  if so then isnt the bible also a form ofhistoryislam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isnt islam aform of christianitycats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form ofanimal based on carbon chemistry so arent dogs a form of cataffirmation of the consequentthis fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore ais true  to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table forimplication given earlierdenial of the antecedentthis fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore bis false  again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this isa fallacynote that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter hasthe form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not infact imply b at all  here the problem is not that the implication isinvalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduceanything about bconverting a conditionalthis fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then aargumentum ad antiquitamthis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simplybecause it is old or because thats the way its always beenargumentum ad novitamthis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy ofasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newerthan something elseargumentum ad crumenamthe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that thosewith more money are more likely to be rightargumentum ad lazarumthe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder ormore virtuous than one who is wealthier  this fallacy is the opposite of theargumentum ad crumenamargumentum ad nauseamthis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true themore often it is heard  an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employsconstant repetition in asserting somethingbifurcationalso referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs whenone presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact otheralternatives exist or can existplurium interrogationum  many questionsthis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complexquestionnon sequitura nonsequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premiseswhich are not logically connected with itred herringthis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issuebeing discussed so that everyones attention is diverted away from thepoints being made towards a different conclusionreification  hypostatizationreification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thingshifting the burden of proofthe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion orproposition  shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum adignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person whodenies or questions the assertion being made  the source of the fallacy isthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwisestraw manthe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that itcan be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented positionthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished  it is afallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have beenmadethe extended analogythe fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested generalrule is being argued over  the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each otherthis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anticryptography legislationi believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking itsuch a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther kingare you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation  how dare youtu quoquethis is the famous you too fallacy  it occurs when an action is argued tobe acceptable because the other party

i posted this a couple of weeks ago and it doesnt seem to have appeared  on the newsgroup and i havent had a reply from the moderator we were  having intermittent problems with our mail at the time please excuse me  if you have seen this beforeshould christians fightlast week alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there  are such things as justifiable wars i have started looking into these  things and have jotted down my findings as i go i havent answered all  his questions yet and i know what i have here is on a slightly different  tack but possibly ill be able to get into it more deeply later and post  some more info soonour duty to our neighbourdo good to all men gal 610love our neighbour as ourselves matt 2239act the part of the good samaritan luke 10 toward any who may be in  trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  people harm even medical corps of the army etcchristians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel  ephesians 21112 and also recognise that god rules in the kingdoms of  men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  of those nations which we are not part of due to our faithwe are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just  passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  this can also be applied to politics etc but thats another story we  are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to  be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  preserving a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up  gods kingdomour duty to the staterender therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god  the things which be gods luke 2025let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power  but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever resisteth  the power resisteth the ordinance of god rom 1312submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether  it be to king as supreme for so is the will of god that with well doing  ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men 1 pet 21315these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  divine command but it is equally clear from acts 51929 that when any  ordinance of man runs counter to gods law we must refuse submission to  it the reason for this is that we are gods bond servants and his  service is our lifes task an example of the type of thing is in col  32223 where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the lord  so  also we should work as if our boss was god  ie pressed down shaken  together and running over oops  a bit of a side track therein the contests between the nations we are on gods side  a side that is  not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truthwhen we believe in god and embrace his promises we become fellow  citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are no longer  interested in associations of the world think of this in relation to  unions etc as well paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may  run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard  any association which would retard our progress  thou therefore endure  hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth  himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath  chosen him to be a soldier 2 tim 234one of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked  together with unbelievers one of the obvious applications of this is  marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business  partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  with any person or persons not believing the truth about god in this case  the army the principle comes from deut 2210  remember that as well as  them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one  unclean under the law these ideas are strongly stressed in 2 cor 61318   i suggest you read this the yoking also has another aspect  that of  servitude and jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked  with christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers we have already seen  that we are bondservants of christ and paul says become not ye the  bondservants of men 1 cor 723 rvan example from the old testament the question is asked in 2 chr 192  shouldest thou help the ungodly the situation here is a good  example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers  jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life here are the facts1 he had made an affinity with ahab who had sold himself to work  wickedness before the lord 1 kings 21252 when asked by ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said  i am as thou art my people as thy people 1 kings 224  an unequal  yoking3 he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  on hearing the prophet of the lord trying to do the right thing he  found that he was yoked and therefore couldnt break away from the evil  association he had madegod says to us come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not  the unclean thing and i will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  daughters 2 cor 617this is more or less what i have found out so far  im still looking into  it as i dont think ive answered all the questions raised by alastair  yet heres a summary and a few things to think aboutthe christian in under command obedience to this command is an essential  factor in his relationship with christ john 151014total dedication to this course of action is required romans 1212disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his  followers 1 pet 278we are to be separated to god rom 64 this involves a masterservant  relationship rom 61216no man can serve two masters matt 6241314all that is in the kosmos is lust and pride  quite opposed to gos 1  john 216 christs kingdom is not of this world ie not worldly in  nature  if it was his servants would fight to deliver him if christ is  our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  was not of this world then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  masterstrangers and pilgrims have no rights and we cannot swear allegiance to  anyone but godthe servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all 2 tim 224   this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout  our lives there is a war to be waged not with mans weapons 2 cor  1034 but with gods armour eph61320ill probably post some more when ive had time to look into things a bit  further,15,christian

ive been thinking about the idea that was raised by michael covington i think that words mean what we think they mean regardless of etymology  ive been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes i grew up in a home where christ was a bad word  people who were very angry said it  the word christian meant someone who was not a jew  it carried connotations of otherness of threat of enemy  it took some time to figure out that there was a connection between christ and christian  when i accepted jesus i expected to be disowned  to become a christian meant to join the enemy  i knew others would consider me a traitor  at some level i agreed but was still prepared to pay this price  like esau i sold my birthright  however i made a better bargain  he only got some stew but i got the incomparable riches of knowing christas it turned out my parents did not disown me  i found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that i would grow out of  by the time they had decided it wasnt a phase they were sort of used to it  they didnt disown me but they didnt completely accept the situation either  for example they didnt come to my wedding because it was in a church   when i visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death she said to me as far as im concerned you still are a jew what she meant was that she loved me and forgave me  but i am not a jew  i am a christian  ill concede one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls i do not keep kosher  i do not celebrate the sabbath on saturday  my sons are not circumcised  but these things are true of some people who do consider themselves jews  it is not these rules that make people jews it is the heritage from the past  i gave up the pastthis is why i find it hard to relate to messianic jews  their experience is unlike mine  they still consider themselves jews while following jesus  some would even say that i must do so too  i am at a stage of my life now where i would like to have a heritage  it was not something i valued very much when i gave it  but i did have a sense that i was giving it for god  it may have been a small sacrifice  it may have been an unnecessary sacrifice  but i gave it and do not want to ask for it backand while i dont have the heritage i was born with i do have another  i am an outcast from the house of israel but i am a member of the church  one of the things i like about being a catholic christian is that it is rich in tradition  it gives me a feeling of once again being rooted in the past this is probably one of the reasons why i dont like it when people mess around with christian traditions for example changing the name of easter  these traditions fill an important emotional need of minei suppose the point of all this is that people shouldnt assume that all believers of jewish background are the same  for some jewish christian is a good name for others it is an oxymoron ,15,christian

 exodus 212225        22 and if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with           child so that she has a miscarriage yet there is no further           injury he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may           demand of him and he shall pay as the judges decide        23 but if there is any further injury then you shall appoint           as a penalty life for life        24 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot        25 burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise the most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry the penalty is only a fine  if however the woman is injured or dies the lex talionis doctrine of an eye for an eye applies  this is the jewish interpretation and is supported by jewish commentaries on these verses    this is quite an embarrassment for prolifer christians so there is of course an alternate explanation  the alternative interprets the word miscarriage to mean premature birthie the child is born aliveand further injury to mean injury to either the woman or the fetus  this is not a straightforward interpretation it is not so far as i know supported by any jewish commentaries and it does not appeared to be supported by any other part of the biblewhat if any historical reference do we have to abortion at this time  didthe ancient jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion i amtruly asking not making a point veiled as a question  if there is little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion it isnot surprising the bible makes little reference to it as it makes littlereference to nuclear power and contamination,0,atheism

its like refusing gods kingdom comein one of jesus revelation in this century same thing as inthe old days  people refuse to believe my messengers  even wheni was alive here on earth they refuse me  what more when i am justtalking through somebody else paraphrasedwith all the knowledge believers accumulated he would think thatwe would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are authentic and divine as opposed to evil or manmadethese signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from godthat these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking  they are evilwell is faith in god evilis true peace evil  is true love that is divine and pure evil why cant someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his  generous love and jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to  him for salvationwhy are we refusing gods messenger of this truth  the mother to all who are  in christwhat brings us these    fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us        which in contrary could be pleasing to god    fears of being humbled    fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is rightwhy cant we tolerate nonbelievers mockery or ridicule of us for the  sake of peace love and obedience to god  the humbling lessons left to us  by martyrs and saintswed rather engage in neverending bickering and disproof of each others  opinion  looking at each others mistakes  for the sake of arguments  instead of having communion in one body with christwhat makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can  not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ageswhy is our faith in god limited  by all the words and literature we musterwhat prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend gods rich love  to others who are notwhy are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith hope  and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his   acknowledgements with signsmiracles ordinarycommon or divinely inspired   everywhere  isnt that like an atheistagnostics view that all these  are just ordinary here on earth and

no one was ever flogged beaten burned fed to the lions or killed in anyother way because of a belief in the resurrection  sorry to disappoint youthe idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of differentforms in the religions of antiquity  the problem was not the resurrectionwhich was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the jewish population the saducees but was a non issues for everyone else  the real problem wasthat christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god  when thestate operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor   monotheism becomes a capital offense  the jews were able to get exemption from thisand were also not evangelistic  christians were far more vocal and gentileand hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution  also sincechristians were a relatively powerless group they made good scapegoats as isseen by neros blaming them for the burning of rome  lets not cloud theissues with the resurrectionrandy,15,christian

davembnrca dave mielke writes   i am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it  gods love is unconditional unqualified unfathomable  we are capable of rejecting gods love but he never fails to love usthese verses do not show that gods love is qualified but rather that he is opposed to evili am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be an innappropriate emphasis on hell  god deserves our love and worship because of who he is  i do not like the idea of frightening people into accepting christ  i see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows gods love with putting into words and explaining that love  preaching the gospel without living the gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a clanging cymbalheres a question  how many of you are christians because you are afraid of going to hell  how many are responding to gods love,15,christian
sorry for posting this but my email keeps bouncing  maybe it willhelp others here anyway and therefore i pray others will read this  it isactually a response from my aunt who has 5 kids since i have none yet     im posting this for a good christian relative who does not have emailaccess  since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids i felt they would be morerelevant than i who have none yet     13yearold 13yo twins 10yo boy 65yo boy 2yo girl     i dont call it spanking but they do so yes very rarely     i dont call it spanking because its more of a reaction to somethingvery dangerous such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or runninginto the road  maybe 34 times for each except for the 2yo girl who hasnot been spanked yet     they call it that because it does hurt their feelings and of coursei give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know theyre still loved     no that would be too painful  if its too traumatic they never recallwhy they were punished  besides it must be immediate and taking the timeto go get a toolmeans youre not doing it right away and that lessens theimpact  its very emotional for a child as it is  which is evidenced by thefact that a little slap on the rear  which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds is called a spanking     lots of logical consequences  for instance when 4yo matthew dareda good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out i madesure they didnt play together for 5 days so hed know that would make himlose friends very quickly  hes never done anything like that since     we also use timeout in their rooms  i use a timer so they dont keeparguing with me over leaving since its hard to argue with a macinei will go to the closed door and tell them timeout wont be over until theycalm down if theyre too tantrumy  i use the top of the stairs when theyrereally young     40     bath ohio  its right outside of akron in the northeast part of ohio     no and none of my kids would dream of it  i hope you can use this toteach all parents that physical punishment isnt always required  parents usethat as an excuse to hit too hard     lots of timeouts same as i use  our family and my husbands have neverused spankings  in fact my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids and theywere almost never spanked  this was around the turn of the century  andnone of us has ever been afoul of the law  manmade or gods law     jesus says referring to a small child whom he is holding that whatye do to the least of these ye do also to me  the bible also says in allthings to be kind and merciful and especially loving colossians 31215there is no room for selfish anger which ill admit ive been tempted withat times  when ive felt like spanking hard in anger maybe the kid deserveda little slap on the rear but what i would have given would have been thedevils work  i could feel the temptation and just angrily ordered the kidto hisher room and went to my room myself  after praying and asking godsforgiveness i was much calmer and did not feel like spanking but felt thatwhat i had done was enough punishment,15,christian
hii dont know much about bible could you tell me the relations ofchristians with nonchristians in bible how should be the relations ofchristian nations with each other and the relations of christian nationswith other nations who are not christiansthe other question is about the concept of religion in bible does thereligion of god include and necessitate any law to be extracted frombible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with thegovernment sides if for example any government or a nation is one ofthe wrongdoings according to bible how should they be treated is there any statement in bible saying that bible is a guide for everyaspects of life  thank you,15,christian
i think this is a weak argument  the fact is there are two references tojesus in _antiquities of the jews_ one of which has unquestionably at leastbeen altered by christians  origen wrote in the third century thatjosephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah while the long passagesays the opposite  there is an arabic manuscript of _antiquities of thejews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gunghofor jesus and may be authentic   there is no question that origen in the third century saw a referenceto jesus in josephus  there are no manuscripts of _antiquities_ whichlack the referencesit is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted buti dont think its very likelynor do i think there is a consensus inthe scholarly community that this is the case i know ga wells takesthis position but thats because he takes the very small minority viewthat jesus never existed  and he is a professor of german not ofbiblical history or new testament or anything directly relevant tothe historicity of jesus,19,misc
    hmmm people in the americas before the time of christ children whodie young etc    but of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect issomething akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least   i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believetheyre going to hell they believe theyre going to _die_ understandthat youve turned hell into a verb using the same logic it also followsthat all animals are going to hell are you sure this is what you wantto say presumably animals dont have the opportunity to get to heavenbut this still doesnt change the fact that theyre going to hell diea final death   i dont claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_sort but if hell is as you described final death andnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true thatthere will never be a moment when i am aware of my nonexistence assuming i go to hell and not to heaven in other words illnever know im dead hmmm     ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died at least shes not suffering any more shes in heaven now     consider the following statement at least shes not suffering any more shes in hell now    the above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of hell it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffering granted they wouldnt be anything wouldnt be having anyconscious experience whatsoever     you say hell death is eternal however this loses its meaning to a dead person and to me it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sensehas force if one expects tobe conscious throughout this eternity     many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply theproduct of propaganda friend do you want the free gift of eternal lifeits my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlifecan anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct allanimals share the difference is we have consciousness and once we get theidea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort ofsupersurvival      that would depend on what heaven is like if god is a king and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the kingi might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary trying toconvert eskimos to christianity in the book _the illusion of immortality_by corliss lamont the missionary started to speak about heaven are there seals in heaven will we be able to go hunting asked aneskimo the missionary said no the group of eskimos then said somethingto the effect of well what good is your heaven if theres no huntingscram i highly recommend the above book ioi to anyone who wants anaccount of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no immortality    pax,15,christian

an interesting interpretation of revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  evangelist david wilkerson  i am not saying that i totally agree with his  interpretation but it is certainly believable and good food for thought  he  interprets the babylon of revelation 1718 as being none other than the good  old u s of a  thats right america  he supports his claim in several ways   the babylon of revelation is the world leader in trade and commerce and the  whole world wept when babylon fell  the american dollar despite the japanese  success of the 20th century is still the most sought after currency in the  world  if the us were destroyed wouldnt the whole world mourn  the bible  also talks about babylon being a home of harlots sin and adultery i am  paraphrasing of course  babylons sin affected or should i say infected  the whole world  it doesnt take much looking to see that the us is in a  state of moral decay  hasnt the american culture and hollywood spread the do  it if it feels good mentality all over the world  i think though that what  mr wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that revelation calls  babylon babylon the great and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  earth  no matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country i  dont think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the us is still the  most powerful nation on earthagain this interpretation is not necessarily my own but i do find it worthy  of consideration,15,christian

the existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does notmean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deedsthere is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but idid not subscribe to that view  god may choose one individual overanother as the fit instrument for his plans but that does notpreclude that the development of that individual into what he is inthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of developmenti do not and rudolf steiner did not subscribe to the oriental viewof an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything thatbefalls one  this is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greaterlaw in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and theultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working ofchrist can be seen as the master theme and indeed a new impulse thatwas completely free of karma  christ incarnated only once in theflesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin  the orientalconcepts of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivializedand mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume jesuschrist to have been the reincarnation of a master  avatar etctheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept thecontinuing individuality from one life to the next eg buddhismmore important they have no concept of the resurrection of the bodythe ultimate continuity of the whole human being  to ultimateresurrection and judgement on the last daythere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing it is thetenth chapter of john devoted almost entirely to the man born blindclearly here jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karmaor that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that anew impulse is to be revealed through him  but note that he does notrefute the disciples question  in fact they ask it as a matter ofcourse the question being stated as if it were self evident that onlyone of two possibilities existed  it was either the sins of the manhimself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of hisparents  the fact that they even asked about the first possibility atall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form ofchrists answer indicates that he did not disagree with itthere is also matthew 1114 where jesus says straight out about johnthe baptist   if you care to accept it he himself is elias who was to comethis also emphasizes that the gospels do not have a positive teachingeither way about reincarnation  or in fact about what happens tothe human being at all between death and the last day  even jesus didnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ifyou care to accept it  so i took care to point out not that thebible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either andthat much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomesunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way  ipointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish a little from theoriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnationthe phrase is rudolf steiners wiederholte erdenleben  he noted toothat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west completelyfree from eastern tradition  it did in the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies the most important expression of it being lessings theeducation of the human raceto return to your original point pauls statement about jacob andesau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karmaand both of these principles receive their fulfillment in theincarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesuschrist in my view,15,christian

butlersubject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judasdate thu apr  1 205211 1993 i can basically restrict this post to showing the type of evidence mr decensohas presented and answering his two questions and a couple of his spuriousinsults and false claims my replyok dbby the way mr decenso you really should have looked in the index of yourbauerarndtgingrich greek lexicon  you would have found that the word inacts for lot is kleros not chorion as stated by mr archer and nowherein the very large discussion of kleros in done the to theological dictionaryof the new testament by bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed  itdiscusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the variousmeanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentionsnothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thusit would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference db later corrected himself_____________________________________________________________________from davebpogowvtekcom dave butlersubject re new biblical contradictions fallaciously answered judasdate fri apr  2 023211 1993 i owe the group an apology  it is my habit to check my articles before andafter their submission for errors  in my last article i stated  i was wrong i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar and thusconfused kleros the second to last word in acts 117 as being the plot ofland discussed  in actuality it is chorion which is the last word acts118  unfortunately my greek dictionary does not discuss chorion so icannot report as to the nuances of the word i dont know if someone else would have caught this though i am sure thatsomeone would be able to do so but i have an aversion to disseminatingmistakes especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point _____________________________________________________________________ my replyvary noble of you dave  i didnt want to have to go to x number of sources toshow you wrong  although i am researching chorion a little dbof course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger  andbullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso ofactually believing bullinger he replied that i misquoted him of  my response to see what i really said in my posting of this article  actually mr decenso you said that there was benefit to our argument in  that it caused to to rediscover bullingers exegisis  i did not realize  that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you were convinced by  it my replythank you for correcting your restating of my points dband mr decenso also replied  thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such drekconvincinghe should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincingand quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of this is what bullingerbelieved not necessarily what i believe so which is it mr decenso do youfind the exegisis convincing or not my replyone of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you andothers is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliationsraised by various bible scholars and students alike  when i present my viewsi will clearly distinguish them from now on dbof course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presentedno greek exegisis at all and mr decenso has made a big thing about my notreferring back to the actual greek  thus we find this demand on his part forquality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement my replygood point  but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory youhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations nor have you dugdeeper  im glad you have begun in this post  i will begin greek studies onthese passages in more depth than i thought necessary as well dbit would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used asevidence  now we know what he claims for a standard as he has stated itoften enough  but are these actual standards he has used or simply empty hyperbole  letssee he has used a and since he is trying to reconcile it to otherpassages we see that he has also used b  on the other hand he haspresented no use of d historical context                ore historical content                orf other pertinent historical info   org cultural context                  orh cultural content                  ori other pertinent cultural info     orj grammatical construction          or evenk hebrew and greek word studies remember archer and bullinger dont count thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings my replyquestion  do you find such criteria important  if so do you plan on startingto use them to the best of your ability or will you continue to presentshallow observations i dont mean this in a bad wayat this point in our _debates_ i have not found it necessary to present atotal exegetical analysis of these passages since we seem to keep beatingaround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses  i do not believeit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments rejudas in acts and matthew but i will do my best from this point on to useseveral of the above criteria since you desire me to  i hope you will alsoit will greatly enhance our study of these passages dbthe only thing he has actually used beyond the passage itself is any otherpassage  thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list isred herring and his only real criteria seems to be  my replythe reason is simpleyou are mistating the passages  you claim that thepassages contradict one another i do not see the passages contradicting oneanother1 they may very well be complimentary as many scholarly sources mention2 matthew may not be presenting judas death as you claim  but well lookat your defense of this later also the reward of iniquity in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces ofsilver in matthews passages  although you have a valiant attempt later atstating why you believe it is at this beginning stages in our debates we are laying some scripturalgroundwork which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis dbof course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passageas he has done with judas death is to make it agree with another passage sothat both could be considered correct my replyone of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages isthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding thesepassages are complimentary  however i see no problem in tony rosesexplanation of judas death _____________________________________________________________________ how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanginghimself in matthew 275 and falling headlong he burst open this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we areconstantly confronted in our travels many people point to the apparentdiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious irreconcilable errorsome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible isdestroyed by these contradictory accounts however this is not the case atallmatthew relates that judas hanged himself while peter tells us he fell andwas crushed by the impact the two statements are indeed different but dothey necessarily contradict each othermatthew does not say that judas did not fall neither does peter say thatjudas did not hang himself this is not a matter of one person callingsomething black and the other person calling it white both accounts can betrue and supplementarya possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung therefor some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judasfell down the ledge mangling his body in the processthe fall could have been before or after death as either would fit thisexplanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of thevalley of hinnom is examined  from the bottom of the valley you can seerocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicularthere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottomtherefore it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks onthis way down tearing his body open it is important to remember that we arenot told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advancedwas the decomposition of his body before his falllouis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himselfthis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed apistol at his head he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window atthe same timeon the other hand a person could say that this man took his life by shootinghimself while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumpingform the tall building in this case both are true as both are true in thecase of matthews and peters accounts of the death of judas it is merely asituation of different perspectives of the same event _____________________________________________________________________ your only reason for rejecting this is i believe your attempt to discreditinerrancy  you havent related how this is impossible or highly unlikelyheres what you said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________db quoting tony rose the added text in this version is so heavy that assuming you are truly soopposed to such tactics you should find it not credible  but you seem tofind tony roses eisegesis satisfactory while clearly rejecting davidjoslins _____________________________________________________________________ here you discredit tonys explanation based on what you deem too heavy forthe passages  but you havent addressed why you feel that way  you can sayits a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that doesnt tell me itdidnt happen nor have you shown why you reject that possibility questions  is matthew lying or is luke lying  or are they both lying  orare either or both of them misinformed  why do you think there is such analleged contradiction  i do not think you have ever told us what you believein this respect dbat present though mr decenso only asks two questions of me  actually i find question 1 to be a rather stupid request but i will answerit because he now restricts himself to two points  first i would point outthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life  in fact it is abit of a fluke when someone survives hanging except in fantasy cowboymovies and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging my replyi work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect  today i got acall re a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his motheris on crack  he failed in his attempt and is in a childs psych ward at alocal hospital  hanging attempts are not always successful to assume that because most hangings are successful this one was also isbegging the question if i may quote you last night listening to _the bible answer man_ broadcast the christianresearch institutes show one of the scholars on there used several of theseterms that you use  i am not all that familiar with them  the man on the bamshow teaches comparative religion and logic  it was interesting dbthis is so prevalent that so that to say a man hung himself with no otherqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself my replyqualifiers are important at times as well see in an ot passage ill mentionbelowdoes hanging always have this outcome  did matthew who is the only source wehave re judas hanging himself state that judas died as a result  to say itssynonymous means it has the same meaning as  a boy age 14 hung himself  buthe lived  this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we candiscover dbnow i am not alone in this thought in fact since mr decenso so respectschristian scholarly including greek scholars opinion i did some research my replythank you dave dbinterestingly not one of the christian references i read interpreted thehanging as being anything but a fatal suicide               my reply above mineso its ok to use christian sources to back your points  what about tonysposition  do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility also is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong or lying ordeceived in other parts of their books  if so should we do as we have donewith archer toss them to the side and not value anything they say includingtheir interpretation of the hanging of judas  i am sure _you_ would findsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources you also noted they interpreted the hanging as meaning he died  althoughthat is very possibly true do you find that in the text itself  rememberthats the first criteria we must examine dbthis included     the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck my replywhich i own  its a good source of commentary info  but not inerrant db    the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible by laydon    the one volume bible commentary by j r dunelow    word meanings of the testament ralph earl    the abingdon bible commentary published by abingdon    harpers bible commentary by william neal     actually i could have presented many more as well my replyi appreciate your doing this research dave  maybe we are getting somewherein how we both should approach these alleged contradictions  more in depthstudy dbin each case these references specifically describe that the interpretationof matt 275 as successful suicide and thus i can only conclude that the                                        greek word apagchwie hang oneself is translated as a successful hanging my reply above mineno you cant only conclude this although as tony says this was a highlyprobable outcome  but matthew does not state death as being a result the greek word is apagcho  matthew 275 is its only occurrence in the newtestament in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesusits only used in 2 samuel 1723  now when ahithophel saw that his advice wasnot followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to hiscity then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and hewas buried in his fathers tomb              notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr septapagcho but it explicitly adds and died  here we have no doubt of theresultin matthew we are not explicitly told judas died also there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure  it simplymeans hang oneself dbbut mr decenso you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                     christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful my replyabove minereputable  you mean ones that have never erredas far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful that cant be doneeven by me  as i said in an earlier post _____________________________________________________________________although i still agree with tonys exegesis as being the most probableexplanation regarding judas death taking into account several criteriaive recently noticed some new things in matthew mat 2758 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departedand went and hanged himself but the chief priests took the silver pieces andsaid it is not lawful to put them into the treasury because they are theprice of blood and they consulted together and bought with them the pottersfield to bury strangers in therefore that field has been called the field ofblood to this day first of all notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result ofhanging all it says is that he went and hanged himself luke however inacts tells us that and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and allhis entrails gushed out this is a pretty clear indication along with theother details given in acts  peters speech the need to pick a new apostleetc that at least after judas fall he was dead so the whole concept that                                                    matthew and luke both recount judas death is highly probable but not clearcut_____________________________________________________________________ i also wrote _____________________________________________________________________my reply here we have a stickler dave that i have to say i just recently noticedlets look at the passage in matthew mat 274 saying i have sinned by betraying innocent blood and they saidwhat is that to us you see to it mat 275 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departedand went and hanged himself mat 276 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is notlawful to put them into the treasury because they are the price of blood mat 277 and they consulted together and bought with them the potters fieldto bury strangers in mat 278 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day notice verse 5then hewent and hanged himselfmatthew does not say judas died does it  should we assume he died as aresult of the hanging                     what does acts sayact 118 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity andfalling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out act 120 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place bedesolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office here we may have a graphic explanation of judas deathso my line ofreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth rethe two accounts of judasdeath is thismatthew doesnt necessarily explain how judas died he does                say judas hanged himself but he didnt specifically say judas died in thehanging incident               however acts seems to show us his graphic demise  therefore there is nocontradiction between matthew and acts re judas death  my replywe do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably recordshis death  although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hangingand hit some rocks thereby bursting open i can no longer assume that to bethe case  therefore no contradiction  matthew did not say judas died as a                                         result of the hanging did he  most scholars believe he probably did but______________________________________________________________________ i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars explanations butin looking at the texts initially we cant assume judas died  it is howeverhighly probable                             dbby the way while all agree that judas died from the hanging the books haddifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing  onesimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthews version asthe correct version in both matt and acts  the biblical knowledge commentarysuggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted his bellyexploded which doesnt explain his headlong fall or that his branch or ropebroke and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out which doesnt explainhow a hanging man would fall headlong rather than feet first my replythe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factorshow high the personwas suspended before the fall any obstructions such as tree branches that mayhave deviated the fall how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fellupon thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks etc  in asuperficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage we are notgiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics but tony in the above quotedpost gave us some _____________________________________________________________________a possible reconstruction would be this judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom after he hung therefor some time the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judasfell down the ledge mangling his body in the processthe fall could have been before or after death as either would fit thisexplanation this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of thevalley of hinnom is examined  from the bottom of the valley you can seerocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicularthere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottomtherefore it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks onthis way down tearing his body open_____________________________________________________________________ dbnow truthfully i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing thesource of the potters field prophesy but on the other hand the author iscorrect matthew does make that confusion  of course a biblical inerrantistwho claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god will have tothereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas ie where theprophesy of the potters field came from my replyplease when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discussthis with you dbas to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that themoney with which judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal ratherthan some other source  i would point out that in acts where it specificallymention the reward of iniquity acts 118 it also specifically mentionswhat act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts 116 concerningjudas who was guide to those who arrested jesus  now i would point outthat when the bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediatelydiscusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest thatit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed my replydave we are getting somewhere arent we act 115 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciplesaltogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty and saidact 116 men and brethren this scripture had to be fulfilled which the holyspirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas who became a guideto those who arrested jesusact 117 for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministryact 118 now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity andfalling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed outact 119 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem so that fieldis called in their own language akel dama that is field of bloodact 120 for it is written in the book of psalms let his dwelling place bedesolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office notice that in verse 16 the word iniquity is not used  rather it statesthat judas became a guide to those who arrested jesusbut the writer did not stop therevs 17 for he was numbered with us andobtained a part in this ministry  what part did judas play in their ministry         joh 126 this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was athief and had the money box and he used to take what was put in itjoh 1329 for some thought because judas had the money box that jesus hadsaid to him buy those things we need for the feast or that he should givesomething to the poor so now we know what part judas played  he was a treasurer per seright after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry treasureraccording to john then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of wages ofiniquity  money that should have been put into the ministry but was stolenby judas to purchase a field  i believe this is a better exegeticalexplanation of what the wages of iniquity are  what do you think dave dbnow since i have given you clear answers and even references perhaps youcould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are instead of askingme what type i think you are as you did to mr joslin my replyi will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist although i do not havethat big a problem with the limited inerrancy viewfrank,19,misc

this book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issuethe book is in two sections  section 1 contains a fairly reasonableanalysis of the bible showing many inconsistencies between the bibleand modern science  well we all know that no surprisessection 2 analyses the korans version of the old testament storiesand seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the koranis consistent with modern science  however it was plain to me thatthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of thekoran  take the flood for example the bible is full of detailforty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc we allknow this is nonsense  the korans description of the same event isso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as a big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage  yes no contradictionbut also not much factthe koran might be consistent with modern science but beingconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of thattime does not seem much of an achievementthe book concludes by saying something like the koran must have haddivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lotof to us now ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of themcan be found in the koran  arguing for the greatness of a book bytalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extremethe above is of course from memory so i may have missed some points ,0,atheism

why are only those people in favor of the system to blame  if societyaccepts such a system then each member of society is to blame whenan innocent person gets executed  those that are not in favor shouldwork to convince othersand most members of our society have accepted the blametheyve consideredthe risk to be acceptable  similarly every person who drives must acceptthe blame for fatal traffic accidents  this is something that is surelygoing to happen when so many people are driving  it is all a question ofwhat risk is acceptable  it is much more likely that an innocent personwill be killed driving than it is that one will be executed,0,atheism
i guess there are at least some people who are not able to supportthis claim there are still a lot of languages without the bible or apart of the bible there are still many languages which we are notable to write simply because the written version of the language hasnot yet been definedi guess this is one of the main goals for wycliffe bible translatorsto define rules and a grammar for writing the rest of the languagesof this world i do not see that any of them will have any reason tobecome unemployed during the foreseeable future provided they gettheir neccessary support and still they are one of the 3 largestmissionary organizations of the worldbjorn,15,christian
ppmy favorite reply to the you are being too literalminded complaint ispthat if the bible is really inspired by god and if it is really thatpimportant to him then he would make damn certain all the translators andpscribes and people interpreting and copying it were getting it rightpliterally  if not then why should i put any merit at all in somethingpthat has been corrupted over and over and over by man even if it wasporiginally inspired by godppthe corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak  comparison of thepcurrent hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the textphas in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia  thispshouldnt be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this mannerpare likely to makes some pains to make good copies,0,atheism

on the question does god hear the prayers of sinners we need todistinguishif we say that he never hears the prayers of any who have sinned wemake pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuriesagobut if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someonewho says lord i want you to do this for me but dont expect meto change my way of life that is a different matter even here iwould not venture to say that god never grants such petitions justas he sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good however ifsomeone we know well is praying to god in that spirit we might havethe responsibility to say remember if gods help is real then soare his commands,15,christian

i agree that there is truth in scripture  there are principles to be learned from it  claiming that that truth is absolute though seems to imply a literal reading of the bible  if it were absolute truth constant across time culture etc then no interpretation would be necessaryit may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person  to me that doesnt mean that one person is right and the other is wrong  i believe that god transcends our simple minds and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent  god knows me and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone elses  by claiming that scripture is absolutethen at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrongi just dont believe that god is that rigidthis is where the arrogance comes in to play  since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals maybe the rest of us should just taketheir word for it  maybe it isnt at all crystal clear to me that their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principlesi think weve established that figuring out biblical truth is a matter of human interpretation and therefore errorprone  yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear  maybe to a certain segment of christianity but to allnot at all  i think it supports my position much more effectively than yours  so i think that your position isthe bible is absolute truth but as we are prone to error in our interpretation we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth isdid i get that rightwhats the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth when we can never know what those truths are and we can never or at least shouldnt act upon them  what practical difference can this make,15,christian

the analogy does not depend on the premisses being true because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance a similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are jehovahs witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion the doctors efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as christians could be perceived to be arrogantthe truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here what matters is that the doctor believes it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance,15,christian

i agree with carol here  determining absolutes is practically speaking awaste of time  and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relativefor example i recently was asking some children the question what temperaturedoes water boil at  i got the answer 212 degrees consistently  i askedif they knew what scale and was told its just 212 degrees  any scalethats what all thermometers say  well thats sincere and may betrue in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong  it is notan absolute truth  similarly scripture is full of truth which we shouldnurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truthand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the timeand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point  then religioneasily becomes an intellectual headtrip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of headcovering in church deletedthis was a good example  there may be an absolute truth behind thewriting but the simplest understanding of the passage is that theinstructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewherethe instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of firstcentury culture and the particular climate at corinth which was havinga lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me  no  and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be even the most diehard literalists do not take all of the bible literallyive yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes yourbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally  the biblewas not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell uswhat parts should be interpreted which way  i agree  very few  and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to anotherthe presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since iknow i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets mei cant prove the existence of absolutes  i can only rely upon my experiencei also trust gods revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinitetherefore we cant comprehend the absolutes  so i dont need them  i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through whichgod is manifested to gods creation  so the reality can be that there areabsolutes but it is of no practical importance  its like claiming that theoriginal scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be  swellwho cares  it doesnt affect me in any practical useful way  i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that theylive on mars  maybe god did  so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god  whether or not i go to this or thatcafeteria for lunch  no  this attitude leads many nonchristians to believe that all christiansare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning  christianity is truewonderful and sensible  it appeals to reason since reason is an innerreflection of the logos of god  explanations that violate that simplyappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex worldnote  im not claiming there is no place for authority thatd be silly       there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian       authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others       authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that       and is generally agressive  good parents like god are authoritative       many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few        adults respond to this treatmentlarry overacker lloshellcom ,15,christian

  no the argument says john has known q ie a codified version of the logiaand not the original assuming that there has been one it has weaknessesof course like that john might have known the original yet rather referredto q in his text or that the logia were given in a codified version inthe first place the argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion but it fits well intothe dating usually given for the gospels   not necessarily luke may have trusted the version he knew better than theversion given by matthew improving on matthew would give a motive forinstance as far as i know the theory that luke has known matthew is based on astatistical analysis of the texts   yep but it will take another day or so to get the source i hope your germanis good enough    i still do not see how copies from 200 allow to change the dating of john   yes but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence the authencity ofmany letters is still discussed it looks as if conclusions about them are notdrawn because some pet dogmas of the churches would probably fall with them aswell   well rather like some newsletter of a political party reporting from thebig meeting not necessarily wrong but certainly bad   yes but the accuracy of their tradition is another problem,0,atheism

yes i do agree with your definition  my use of the term always israther deceptive i admit   hold it  i said that all of scripture is true  however discerningexactly what jesus paul and company were trying to say is not always soeasy  i dont believe that paul was trying to say that all women shouldbehave that way  rather he was trying to say that under the circumstancesat the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility andcover their heads  this has to do with maintaining a proper witness towardothers  remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derivedfrom absolutes  for instance it is absolutely right for christians tostrive for peace  however this does not rule out trying to maintain worldpeace by resorting to violence on occasion  yes my opinion sure  the bible preaches absolute truths  however exactly what thosetruths are is sometimes a matter of confusion  as i said the bible doespreach absolute truths  sometimes those fundamental principles are crystalclear at least to evangelicals  sometimes they are not so clear toeveryone eg should baptism be by full immersion or not etc  that islargely because sometimes it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writersare speaking to a particular culture or to christianity as a whole  this is where scholarship and the study of biblical contexts comes in   god revealed his truths to the world through his word  it is utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate interpretations  practically anything can be misinterpreted especiallywhen it comes to matters of right and wrong  care to deny that,15,christian

remainder of message deletedpardon me for replying to only a portion of your message the reason we can say god just exists and cant say the universe just exists is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular  that is we observe in nature that every cause has an effect and every effect was produced by a cause  the existence of the natural realm as an effect itself cannot be its own cause it must therefore have a supernatural causegod on the other hand is a supernatural being and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect  as a supernatural being gods eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical natural cosmos does  thus those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal god whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existencethis is of course an oversimplification of a complex topic but i just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural god and the natural the universe since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable,15,christian

i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible the quran andscience by maurice baucaille a french surgeon  it is not comprehensivebut it is well researched  i imagine your library has it or can get itfor you through interlibrary loan  i shall try to get hold of it when i have time to read of course in short dr baucaille began investigating the bible because of preceived scientific inaccuracies and inconsistencies  he assumed thatsome of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in bygone days  so he read what he could find in hebrew greek aramaicwhat he found was that the problems didnt go away they got worsethen he decided to see if other religions had the same problemsso he picked up the holy quran in french and found similar problems but not as many  so he applied the same logoic as he hadwith the bible he learned to read it in arabic  the problems hehad found with the french version went away in arabic  he was unableto find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy quran butwhat he did find made sense with modern understanding  so heinvestigated the traditions the hadith to see what they had tosay about science  they were filled with science problems afterall they were contemporary narratives from a time which had bypour standards a primitive world view  his conclusion was thatwhile he was impressed that what little the holy quran had tosay about science was accurate he was far more impressed that theholy quran did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced inthe traditions  how would a man of 7th century arabia have knownwhat not to include in the holy quran assuming he had authoredit      so in short the writer or writers of quran decided to stay away fromscience  if you do not open your mouth then you dont put you foot intoyour mouth either    but then if you say quran does not talk much about science then one cannot make claims like bobby does that you have great science in quran   basically i want to say that none of the religious texts are supposed tobe scientific treatises so i am just requesting the theists to stop makingsuch wild claims vinayak                                           vinayak dutt                                   email vdpmayoedu             standard disclaimers apply,0,atheism

why do babies get diseases etc heres the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only doesnot support it but indicates something far different the earth bylatest estimates is about 46 billion years old and has had life forabout 35 billion of those years humans have only been around for atmost about 200000 years but the fossil evidence inidcates that lifehas been changing and evolving and in fact diseaseridden long beforethere were people yes there are fossils that show signs of diseasemostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not justfossil evidence but what weve been able to glean from genetic study showsthat disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was whatbrought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily thenhow could it exist before humansdeletions uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more aboutbiology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this thereis no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started offin perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in acollective sense im really curious as to what you mean by thedegeneration of the genetic code umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses andbacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife isharmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalbyconstant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonicplague used to be a really nasty disease im sure youll agree butit still pops up from time to time even today and doesnt do asmuch damage part of that is because of better sanitation but evenwhen people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than inthe past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptibledied off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazedforgive the poor terminology im an engineer not a doctor   anddied off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a fewhundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems tobe getting less nasty wage now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect rightand you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease itseems unlikely that satan whos making the diseases would also gifthumans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases lesslethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systemsimperfect though they may presently be must have been built into usby god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planningahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immunesystem that was not at the time of design necessary that is god madeour immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin andtheir descendents would need to fight off diseases heres another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in thephrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfectsystem would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect systemthat will without constant intervention become imperfect is not aperfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on abunch of gum wrappers held together with elmers glue that is theoriginal genetic instructions were perfect but were written ininferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apartif so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itselfof did it just choose not todeletions my main point as i said was that there really isnt any evidence forthe explanation you give at least that im aware of but i couldnthelp making a few nitpicks here and there sincerely,0,atheism

noerdlingenbeck 1886  portions of this are described in nibley _the prophetic book op mormon_ pp 219242 slc  deseret book 1989if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned  nibleydescribes blass as a typical german scholar who claims littleknowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subjectand the reader  nibleys extract from blasss work is in the formof rules for forgers  it makes interesting readingi confess that i have not read blasss work only nibleys extractthereof  my german falls far short of what would be required andas far as i know there is no english translation available  howeveri believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancientdocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame  we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgeryactually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents1  alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof  for examplethe dead sea scrolls  these can be tested by various scientificmeans to determine the age of the paper inks and objects foundwith them  this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actualphysical objects2  documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although thecopy itself may be much more recent  for example we might find adocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of somethingfrom centuries ago perhaps even having been through severalgenerations of copists  this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple  we cannotexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much sowe must confine our testing to the text itselfit is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us ifthe document is really what it claims to be  they can only date thedocument and identify its culture of origin  for example ive heardof a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a kingin what is now iraq  if this document were to actually turn upscholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have theholograph  they could check the language content and writingstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of apalestinian jew of that time  however even if all test results werepositive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actuallywrote it  we would know what time and culture it came from butbarring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there  there is seldom any way todetermine who the actual author wasas i say im no expert on blass work  i do remember some of thetests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works  specifically we might ask1  is the document internally consistent  does it contradictitself  if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery  the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistencyfor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents2  is it consistent with the history and geography of the timeagain a short nonspecific work might not be testable but if thewriting is of any significant length no latterday forger would beable to escape detection  here we look for the minor inconspicuousthings which someone from that culture would get right without eventhinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check  the devil is in the details3  what about the literary style of the work figures of speechetc  any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us  are there any such odd phrases in this book  if so do they fit in with the cultureof course there are complications if the document has beentranslated or possibly even if somebody just updated languagewhen he copied it  a few cases of language not from the cultureclaimed may be allowed in recent copies  they cause problems andreduce certainty to be sure but dont necessarily prove forgerythese tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy  they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc  the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin  if there are things which dont fit how significant are they  are problem areas due toour lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant  there will often be some ambiguity since we neverknow everything about the culture,15,christian

koberg	just a couple of minor corrections here	1  the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking intongues in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed topentecostal teaching  you are probably thinking of church of god inchrist the largest africanamerican pentecostal denomination	2  im not sure what you mean by signifying believers  but itshould be pointed out that the assemblies of god does not now nor has itever held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a christian the doctrine that traditional pentecostals including the ag maintain isthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becominga christian in which one is baptized in the holy spirit  that may bewhat you were referring to but i point this out because pentecostals arefrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in orderto be a christian  such a position is only held by some groups and not themajority of pentecostals   many pentecostals will quote the passage inmark 16 about these signs following them that believe but they generallydo not interpret this as meaning if you dont pactice the signs you arentsaved	3  i know its hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement thathas such diversity but i think youve made some pretty biggeneralizations here  do neopentecostals only believe in tongues as asign and tongues as prayer but not tongues as revelatory with a message ive never heard of that before  in fact i would have characterized themas believing the same as pentecostals except less likely to see tongues asa sign of spirit baptism  also while neopentecostals may not beinclined to speak in tongues in the nonpentecostal churches they attendthey do have their own meetings and in many cases a whole church will becharismatic,15,christian

based on deception  theres no realityin it he says i was selling a product and my product was a lie  headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage theorganizations of the exgay movement rely on the tenents of bornagainchristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals  usually young gay men whoare just coming out  that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing theirsexual urges and embracing christianity  we offer support to people who areseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality explains bob davies director ofexodus  he ventures that about 80 of those seeking to abandon their homosexuality are men  anybody who is involved in the exgay ministry is misguided and is wastingtheir time says lisa seeley a former redeemed lesbian who worked withcaligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show  theseorganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded  its possible to change your identity or your behavior says sex educatorbrian mcnaught author of _on being gay_ but its really impossible tochange your orientation  these people are no longer calling themselves gaybut they continue to have samesex erotic feelings  caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when allhell broke loose in his personal life  a few days after his lover ended boththeir romance and their business partnership caligiuri was sexually assaultedby a man he picked up in a bar  i was really drunk he recalls and iwent home with this guy  he tied me up and raped me  he left me tied up allnight and the next morning he raped me again  when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker he returned home to thehome he shared with his exlover  he had another man there with himcaligiuri recalls  i thought at this time if this is what being gay isabout i dont want to be this way anymore  caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out he would share his discoverywith others  he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenixsgay pride parade in june 1985 and a few months later free indeed held itsfirst public protest  at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinancefree indeed members loudly blasted gays telling them ther were sinners headedfor hell  free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week thanksin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages  we were listedunder lesbian and gay alternative services caligiuri says so peoplethought we were a gay information switchboard  people would call to find outwhere the local bars were and wed preach to them about the sins of homosexuality  ruses like this are typical of the movement caligiuri saysadding theyll do anything to reach these people  david used to go on radio and say really stupid things recalls peterkelly a counselor at phoenixs catholic diocese aids program like thathe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors  caligiuris family first found out about his ministry when they saw him onraphaels syndicated talk show in 1985  they were relieved he recallsthey figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family betterthat i should be a reformed gay person  but caligiuri was hardly reformed  by the time i appeared on sallysshow id started having sex with men again  men would call our hotlineand tell me about thier latest sin sex with their pastor sex with theirfather  i was horny all the time  unable to risk going to gay bars where he might be recognized from hisnumerous television appearances caligiuri says he used to go to bookstoresand get blowjobs  when he wasnt working the bookstores he was sleepingwith other reformed homosexuals  i didnt realize it at first but a lot of the ha leaders were having sexwith one another caligiuri says  wed go to conferences in other citiesand wed be paired up in hotel rooms  everybody was sleeping with everybodyelse  by the time he appeared on am philadelphia television show in may 1988caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week  when the showshost asked him if he ever acted on temptation his answer was a lie  caligiuris duplicity began to take its toll on him however  he wassuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitatingyeast infection and this led to his escape from the sect  i was too sickto go to church he explains  the more time i spent away from those peoplethe more i began to feel like myself  i began to remember who i used to be  late in 1991 caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a localchurch and closed the ministrys doors  id convinced myself that thereis no need in the world for exgay people he says  today caligiuri 31 is studying alternative spiritualities im interested in belief systems that arent judgemental considering romance butnot with a christian and searching for a new project to devote himself toi feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes he says  i want toeventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage imay have brought to our communityend articlecaligiuris tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articlesof former leaders and founders of exgay ministries who have said very similar thsimilar things  fortuantely not all of them have left christianity but havecome to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others  somelike chris glaser director of the presbyterian lazarus project of westhollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay communityto bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical valuesof sexuality within the sphere of being gay  i have also as i said talked and becomeand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as love inaction and others who either once claimed to have been reformed or whowere too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who was disappointedin them  some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing theirnew heterosexuality only to eventually start hitting the bars bathhousesand bookstores since these were usually activities under the concealment ofnight and onenightstands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sinthrough a committed relationship  this is a horrible trap which the churchhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people and the very innocent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages  yetthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allowgay people 1 heterosexuality or 2 celebacy  this is sad  what is alsomrtifying is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires andfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces onthem they may even opt for suicide or surgical dampering of the brainfunctions  in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were commonplace  there are now becoming available more and more literature on thethreat of coercive christianity toward gays such as sylvia penningtons_exgays  there are none_ and others  there are also a great many factbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such asmaury johnstons _gays under grace_ and chris glasers _come hom_  iseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution andselfacceptance,19,misc

dear defiant or unfaithful or pixiei will take up the challenge to reply as i am a theistthe foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existenceof god could not be proven  that his existence can be proven by reasonis indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologicanow given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reasoni assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallencondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith  whybecause god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matterthe independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence themeasure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives orderto the universe logosi next assert that god is all good  if this is so then that which iscontrary to the will of god is evil ie the absence of the good  andsince god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savioras early as the protoevangelium of genesis 35 god instructs that becausea human adam was first responsible for mans alienation from the sourceof all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendshipthus god became incarnate in the person of the messiahnow this messiah claimed that he is the truth john 146  if this claimis true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnateyou next seem to have a problem with authority  have you tried the unitedstates marine corps yet  i can tell you firsthand that it is an excellentinstructor in authority  if you have not yet had the privilege i willreply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questionedand thus must be followed blindly  one may not deny the truth  forexample when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newtons head he couldhave denied that it happened but he did not  the laws of physics mustbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not  they are true therefore the authority which is truth may not be deniedqed  boundary,15,christian

  there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature  exclusivelythis definition does not include all atheists see the faq howeveri for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine orspiritual explanations it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understoodas natural processes and to claim that our observations do notrequire us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritualfor that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is sciencehowever science has one advantage theology doesnt it is selfcorrecting with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a selfconsistent simple picture of our universe science is no longera bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics topsychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safefrom its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determninedactually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical questionand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehowsuperdeterministic or not i think the question does not haveany meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparentfree will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from theirperspective bill can you say _for sure_ whether you have a freewill or not  this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence its just a happy accidentmaybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful  whenduring the history of earth has _one species_ been able to controlone third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicatesand preserves even that machinery can be result of the sameprinciple  only the systems that can start replicating willsurvive those which dont dont make it recommended reading to for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective i value events and things subjectively frommy perspective nature does not have values because it does not havea perspective  values arise from awareness if i have a subjectiveperspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and ifi think about what it would it be like in their position i willeventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarilya gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolutionperhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identityis helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respectothers who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea spfor starters how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your valuescs lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason whyhe abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument isseverely flawedsome values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis someothers like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably itsroots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very realpossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruisticbehaviour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved betterand better in building and using tools they also became betterat killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution couldonly favour those who knew how to use tools but not against onesown peoplethe bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jewswas not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the peopletogether under one god their god did not care much about peopleof other nations at the time of the nt things were quite different  the jewswere under rule of an _empire_ and could no longer simply ignorethe gentiles a new situation required a new morality and alongwith it a new religion was born a mutation in a meme pool since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that heshe just doesnt like it  thats it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute senseit looks like you havent bothered to read philosophy whenever thereis an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a resultof some physical event and others happiness too if the observercomes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that iswithout any observers or subjects moral judgments lose theirmeaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point ofview this includes gods too their values are only _their_ personal judgments not absolute truths since such truthsdo not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt othersis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existenceby becoming social beings who can think and value othersexistencemorality is not property of humans alone  chimps dolphins andmany other species show great care for each other dolphins havesometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed  that you dont like what god told people to do says nothing about god or gods commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a preexisting thoughtset to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way youve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual realitythe last statement does not logically follow in fact there isevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality verywell and our senses can convey reliable information solipsismis still a logical possibility but not a very likely oneyou are continuously mixing two different views the subjectivepoint of view which we all share and an objective point of view_which does not exist_ any observer or thinker any personal beinghas its own point of view it does not matter whether this pointof view is a result of some physical events or not it does notcease to be subjective from a nonobservers nonpoint of view values do not exist neitherdoes pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are inherently subjective once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or evento make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us ifwe dont i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals comefrom any supreme being  to remove my morals means the same thanto make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if godgave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not myfault he is free to replace my morals i cannot see what is thepoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with onesown and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoeverneither can the opinion of any god for that matter i cannot understandwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any wayless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something elsebill take note absolute values must be independent of _any_ being_including_ gods if god has a subjective viewpoint

can someone cite biblical references to homosexuality being immoral otherthan leviticus so far when i ask around here i get the verses fromleviticus spouted at me but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by christians havent seen any stonings in a _long_ time latermax bob muirthe list was posted not long ago as i recall aside from lev commonlycited passages arethe story of sodom  note however that this was a homosexual rape andtheres no disagreement that that is wrong  i take an intermediateposition on this note that sodom is referred to elsewhere in thebible for its sinfulness  it doesnt seem to have been knownspecifically for homosexuality  rather i think it was considered acesspool of all sins however from what we know of jewish attitudeshomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed  it almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape ofguests who were actually angels  but this story is not specificallyabout homosexualityin the nt the clear references are all from pauls letters  in rom1 there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evilnote that the passage isnt about homosexuality  its aboutidolatry  homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or atleast result of idolatry  there are a number of arguments over thispassage  it does not use the word homosexuality and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexualityso its not what id call an explicit teaching against all homosexualitybut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anywaythat paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards homosexualitythe other passages occur in lists of sins in i cor 69 and i tim110  unfortunately its not entirely clear what the words used heremean  there have been suggestions that one has a broader meaningsuch as wanton and that another may be specifically maleprostitute  again we dont have here a precise teaching abouthomosexuality but it is at least weak supportive evidence that paulshared the ots negative judgement on homosexualityjude 17 is sometimes cited however its probably not relevant  thecontext in jude involves angels  since those who were almost raped insodom were angels it seems likely that strange flesh refers tointercourse with angelsas you can see the nt evidence is such that peoples conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the bible  conservatives note thatthe passages from pauls letters imply that he accepted the otprohibition  this is enough for them to regard it as having ntendorsement  liberals note that theres no specific teaching and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why is the concern inrom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship  what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean  thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as a attitude paul took with him from hisbackground and not a specific teaching of the gospelthis is an explosive topic which tends to result in longdissertations on the exact meaning of various greek words  but itsclear to me that thats mostly irrelevant  what it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the gospel  thisappears to depend upon ones reaction to the message of the bible as awhole as well as ones perception of the needs of the church todaythis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the differencebetween protestant and catholic in the 16th cent and one where bothsides believe that the bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses  that makes thingsvery frustrating for a moderator who realizes that such an optimisticoutcome is not very likely,15,christian

i agree entirely  speaking as an atheist heterosexual for what itsworth this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties ofchristianity  although im sure its possible to argue theologicallythat we shouldnt make analogies between discrimination on the basisof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationmorally the case looks unanswerable for those outside religion thethree forms _are_ analogous we shouldnt discriminate on the basis ofsex race or sexual orientationi found the moderators faqs on the subject instructive and recommendeveryone to read themthere seem to be three different levels of acceptance1 regard homosexual orientation as a sin or evil whatever2 regard homosexual behaviour as a sin but accept orientationthough presumably orientation is unfortunate and dislike people whoindulge3 as 2 but love the sinner4 accept homosexuality altogethermy experience is that 3 is the most common attitude i imagine 1 and 2are limited to a few fundamentalist sectsi suppose i can go along with 3 except that i have this feeling thata 1415 year old living in a community with this attitude ondiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sexwould not feel the love of the community but would rather feel thepressure not to exhibit their feelings  im not saying that thecommunity in particular the parents would not love the child but isuspect the child would not feel loved,15,christian

yes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic lawshowever i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in allfive schools of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be levelled againstmuslim or nonmuslims both within and outside daralislam i donot know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent andopen hostility to islam falls into this category of the law i do knowthathistorically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let aloneby the death penaltymy understanding is that khomeinis ruling was not based on thelaw of apostasy alone it was well known that rushdie was an apostatelong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is noprecedent in the quran hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantlylevelling death penalties for apostasyi believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad thisruling applies both within and outside the domain of anislamic state and it can be carried out by individuals the reward wasnot offered by khomeini but by individuals within irani would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember waslevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publicationof the book however the charge of fasad can encompass anumber of lesser charges i remember that when diplomatic relationsbroke off between britain and iran over the fatwa  iran stressed thatthe condemnation of the author and the removal of the book fromcirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving thecrisis but you are correct to point out that banning the book was notthe main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charges such as fasad arelevelled at people not booksthe rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before theissuance of the fatwa rushdie went on a media blitzpresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values ofsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of peoplecrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boosthis image and push the book he was everywhere in the media thenmuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed whileprotesting against the book rushdie appeared momentarilyconcerned then climbed back on his media horse to once againattack the muslims and defend his sacred rights it was at thispoint that the fatwa on fasad was issuedthe fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie  any actions ofrushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization ofthe ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independantwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwaagainst the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well thecrime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was beingplayed out and played up in the the full view of the media,0,atheism

reference line trimmedwell id say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murderfor instance if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to containblanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actuallyperformed the action isnt the murderer but i guess this is actually madeclear in the below definitionwhat do you mean by reasonableyes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition  buteven though the series is recursively infinite i think the meaning canstill be deducedmath lesson deletedokay lets look at this situation  suppose there is a longstandingfeud between two families which claim that the other committed sometravesty in the distant past  each time a member of the one familykills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justifiedin killing a that member of the first family  now lets suppose that thissequence has occurred an infinite number of times  or if you dontlike dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the familygoes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing  that is thereis a neverending loop of slayings based on some nonexistent travestyhow do you resolve thiswell they are all murdersnow i suppose that this isnt totally applicable to your problem butit still is possible to reduce an uninduced systemand in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murdercannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanityand a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved  so thefirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarilya murderer  is this enough of an induction to solve the apparentlyunreducable definition  see in a totally objective system where all theinformation is available such a nested definition isnt really a problem,0,atheism

the elders and the chief priests     and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise again                                         mark 931 for he was teaching his disciples and telling them the son     of man is to be delivered into the hands of men and they will     kill him and when he has been killed he will rise three days     later                                     mark 1034 and they will mock him and spit upon him and scourge him     and kill him and three days later he will rise again                       mark 1226 but regarding the fact that the dead rise again have you     not read in the book of moses in the passage about the burning     bush how god spoke to him saying i am the god of abraham and     the god of isaac and the god of jacobluke 1833 and after they have scourged him they will kill him and     the third day he will rise again      luke 2446 and he said to them thus it is written that the christ     should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day     john 1125 jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he     who believes in me shall live even if he diesjohn 209 for as yet they did not understand the scripture that he     must rise again from the dead                                   acts 173 explaining and giving evidence that the christ had to     suffer and rise again from the dead and saying this jesus whom     i am proclaiming to you is the christ the witness of the apostle paul  1 corinthians 15126 1 now i make known to you brethren the gospel which i preached to   you which also you received in which also you stand 2 by which also you are saved if you hold fast the word which i   preached to you unless you believed in vain 3 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received   that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day   according to the scriptures      5 and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve 6 after that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one   time most of whom remain until now but some have fallen asleep 7 then he appeared to james then to all the apostles 8 and last of all as it were to one untimely born he appeared to me   also 9 for i am the least of the apostles who am not fit to be called an   apostle because i persecuted the church of god10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me did   not prove vain but i labored even more than all of them yet not i   but the grace of god with me11 whether then it was i or they so we preach and so you believed12 now if christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead13 but if there is no resurrection of the dead not even christ has   been raised14 and if christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your   faith also is vain15 moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god because we   witnessed against god that he raised christ whom he did not raise   if in fact the dead are not raised16 for if the dead are not raised not even christ has been raised17 and if christ has not been raised your faith is worthless you are   still in your sins18 then those also who have fallen asleep in christ have perished19 if we have hoped in christ in this life only we are of all men most   to be pitied20 but now christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of   those who are asleep21 for since by a man came death by a man also came the resurrection   of the dead22 for as in adam all die so also in christ all shall be made alive23 but each in his own order christ the first fruits after that those   who are christs at his coming24 then comes the end when he delivers up the kingdom to the god and   father when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet26 the last enemy that will be abolished is death             logical proofs of jesus christs resurrection            1  jesuss enemies would not have stolen his                body because that would have perpetrated the                resurrectionthe very opposite of what they                desired            2  jesus disciples could not have stolen his                body because pontius pilate established guards                to stand watch over the tomb lest his body be                stolen            3  sadly and ironically many of jesus disciples                did not believe in the resurrection until jesus                had risen from the dead            4  in nearly 20 centuries no body has ever been                produced to refute jesus assertion that he                would indeed rise from the dead,15,christian

i beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of modelsscientific models are a game to play and are only as good as theassumptions and measurements if any that go into themas an example i remember when nuclear winter was the big hype inatmospheric science  it wasnt long after sagans admonitions thatone of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model ofthe nuclear winter scenario at erl in boulder  he decided to assumethat the atmosphere is more like a twodimensional thing than a onedimensional thing  he also assumed that it rained and that the windsblow in the real atmosphere  on returning to georgia tech he showeda transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year theywere generated by the models  there was an unmistakable correlationbetween the age meaning simplicity of assumptions ie remotenessfrom reality of each model and the degree of cooling  whereas sagansmodel showed an approximate 40degree cooling episode the next model in sophistication showed about half that and so on until we got toour boys model which showed a 12 degree drop if the war happened inthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summerhe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans chemistrythe biosphere and other indicators of reality in the models we wouldprobably see even less cooling  thus nuclear winter was reduced to evenless than a nuclear autumn one might say to a nuclear fizzleto quote from hs yoder	the postulated models have become accepted as the reality	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are	authoritarianism dominates the field and a very critical	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged skepticism	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because	many key parameters have not been includedthis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony  only whenconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled resultsmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality  just thoughtid clear that up before things really got out of hand   boundary,15,christian

to what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have done so so i will confinemyself to answering the charge of illogic this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or wastaught to think it is the fundamental premis a is not nota if a thingis true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible weshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believehowever the weak sense means i am not sure i believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sensemeans i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought i believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christianbelief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefsof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again a matter of pure logic thatif christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly befalse insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as a matter of logic vice versa it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinksand wantsmost christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the livingtradition of the church established by christ and guided constantlyby the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that traditionif depends what you mean by differing if i believe tom is six feettall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleivethat he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone whodoes not share your belief on this point is wrong qedhere i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with theknowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is halffull it is the same fact expressed in different words the wholepoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimistand the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may failto understand each others words as expressions of the same beliefand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart greatscisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work hasbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which concealagreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefsare equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradictsome other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscationsof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs havebeen stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold mustnecessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogicalto say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y is equivalent to notx then one of us is wrong and as longas we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error,15,christian
dr englands story deleted it was a nice read the first time through	it isnt so much a matter of interpretation of bible texts that sets mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of fabrication	about 20 years ago _national lampoon_ had some comic strips in them that were drawn by neal adams they were called son o god comics it was a parody of the jesus in the bible in the comic there were a group of thirteen jewish kids from brooklyn and when one of them said the magic word he turned into son o god he went from a myopic curly headed yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of jesus  with long flowing brown hair and gentile features		now if someone were to profess faith in this natlamp jesus and claim that they were a christian because they believed in this natlamp jesus we would have to say that this was fallacious since this jesus was a fabrication and did not really exist	this is the exact same thing that the lds do when they claim that they are christian they profess faith in jesus but the jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the natlamp jesus was,19,misc

actually i dont think there is any conflict if we really understandwhat these passages say  first what is faith  if you study the meaning of the greek and hebrew words so translated i think you willcome to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere belief  faith means both trust and action  if you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith  i think this is what james means when he says that faith without works is dead and i will show you my faith by my works  remember james was writing to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad  this probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldnt understand the meaning of the original greekindeed i suspect james was writing to us today among others heintended to reach  paul on the other hand wrote mostly to thepeople of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning ofthe greekanother key to why there is no conflict is to look at paulsstatements in their context  i think you will find that when paulcontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing thegospel with the law meaning the law of moses  this was the greatburden of pauls life  as the apostle to the gentiles he would goconvert a bunch of people then the judizers would come along andtry to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses cfacts chapter 15  in this context paul condemns the idea of beingsaved by the works of the law saying that we are saved by the bloodof jesus and our faith in him  i believe that a better translationfor today would be that we are saved by faithfulness  i thinkfaithfulness today has a meaning closer to what the originalwriters intendedi think you misunderstand romans  what paul is really saying isthat god prefers a faithful gentile who does not keep kosher to akosher jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important mattersof following the lord and having charity toward his fellowsin the sense of faith described above you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm  if you know god but are lukewarm unfaithful you are worse off than the person who never heard of him  remember jesus inthe parable of the pearl of great price mat 134546 and again inthe one on the treasure hidden in the field mat 1344 indicates thatthe price of the kingdom of god is all we havei agree with you in general including the fact that pistis hassome of the force of faithful  however if you take that too faryou can end up with something that paul definitely would not haveintended  being faithful means following god in all things  to saythat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that weare saved by commiting no sins  i assume thats not what you meanti have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula thatcompletely captures this  however i think paul is describing what idcall a basic orientation including aspects such as trust andcommitment  jesus speaks of it as rebirth which implies a basicchange  we may still do things that are sinful and may fail to showthe new life in christ in many situations where we should  but in anychristian there had better be the basic change in orientation thatjesus calls being born again,15,christian

i differ with our moderator on this  i thought the whole idea of god comingdown to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one ofthe consecration prayers in the book of common prayer 1979 puts it wasthat jesus was tempted but did not succumb  if sin is not part of thebasic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would notbe subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaningbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin  to distinguishbetween human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at thetime we need him mostfirst the monophysites inherited none of nestoriuss version  they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him  second the historicalrecord suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not asextreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional historyclaimed  mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguingi think correctly that a human could not be called mother of god  i meanin the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate  surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary  anyway nestoriussopponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimedthat she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would requiretwo seperate and distinct natures  the argument fails though becausemary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinelyif you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwineda la chalcedonsecond i am not sure that nestorianism is not a better alternative thanthe orthodox view  after all i find it hard to believe that preincarnationthat jesuss human nature was in heaven likewise postascension  i thinkrather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him  it was a seperatenature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since i believe the divinenature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine natureprevailedcomments on the above warmly appreciatedjason albertthere may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin  theoriginal complaint was from someone who didnt see how we could calljesus fully human because he didnt sin  i completely agree thatjesus was subject to temptation  i simply object to the idea that bynot succumbing he is thereby not fully human  i believe that you donot have to sin in order to be humani again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism  iagree with you and have said elsewhere that theres reason to thinkthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was infact heretical  there are scholars who maintain that nestorius wasnot nestorian  i have to confess that the first time i read some ofthe correspondence between nestorius and his opponents i thought hegot the better of themhowever most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led tochalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very leastrash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversyrefers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own  asregular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much animpediment as being wrong  furthermore he did say some things that ithink are problematical  he responds to a rather mild letter fromcyril with a flame worthy of usenet  in it he says to attribute alsoto the logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristicsof the flesh that has been conjoined with him  is my brothereither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of thegreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius andapollinaris and the others  those who are thus carried away with theidea of this association are bound because of it to make the divinelogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to somedegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of hisfearfulness   these things are taken falsely when they are put offon the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for uswho perpetrate the falsehoodits all well and good to maintain a proper distinction betweenhumanity and divinity  but the whole concept of incarnation is basedon exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to somedegree a part in being born growing up and dying  of course itmust be understood that theres a certain indirectness in the logosparticipation in these things  but there must be some sort ofidentification between the divine and human or we dont have anincarnation at all  nestorius seemed to think in black and whiteterms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with thisareayou say i find it hard to believe that preincarnation that jesusshuman nature was in heaven  i dont think thats required byorthodox doctrine  its the divine logos that is eternal,15,christian
while i agree with most of jon says i deleted those parts of course i have serious reservations about this advice  maintaining a just friends level of relationship is much easier said than done  people usually end up getting hurt  this is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction  when people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement  ive had the experience of going quickly from believing that i shouldnt date nonchristians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other  when the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state  this is an especially extreme case because i was young and away from home and fellowship  i dont think it would work exactly this way for most people  however its important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction  ,15,christian

ok heres at least one christians answerjesus was a jew not a christian  in this context matthew 51419 makessense  matt 517 do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law orthe prophets i did not come to abolish but to fulfill  jesus livedunder the jewish law  however he was the culmination of the promisesof the prophets  he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obeygods purposesverse 18 says for truly i say to you until heaven and earth passaway not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the lawuntil all is accomplished  the key to this verse imho is the last phrase  jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplished what the law was supposed to accomplish  verse 19  whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandmentsand so teaches others shall be called least in the kingdom of heavenbut whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in thekingdom of heaven  taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish people about living lives under the law this makes sensein general it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about doing away with the law  that was not jesus intent at all  he had come to earth to live the law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his people all the way back to eve gen 315the serpent will bruise your heel but he will bruise his head  jesus appeared to be doing away with the law because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the law of god  he regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules only gods lawin the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law and defending himself against his accusors  almost the entire sermon on the mount matt 57 is dedicated to helping the jewish people understand the true intent of the law sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditionsin galatians 32326 paul describes the relationship of jesus to the law in this way23 but before faith came we were kept in custody under the law being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed  24 therefore the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ that we may be justified by faith  25  but now that faith has come we are no longer under a tutor  26 for you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesusi believe this says that after christ was revealed the law had served its purpose ie our tutor to lead us to christ andnow we are no longer under a tutor  the law has been fulfilled as christ said he would dogod the author of the old law and the christman jesus are the samepersonality  therefore the old law and the new testament the lastwill and testament of jesus are based on the same moral principles it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law arereexpressed in christianity on the other hand now that the law has fulfilled its purpose and christians relate to god through christ not the law it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the mysteries of this new relationship  ie baptism representing christs death burial and resurrection rom 638the lords supper as a memorial to his sacrifice i cor 1126 andsunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection matt 281ffacts 207ok thats one christians explanation  i dont claim to have allthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcomeother christians to offer other alternativesplease excuse the long posting  thanks for your interest if you have read this far,19,misc

in  frankd012s658uucp frank odwyer in article  cobbalexialisuiucedu mike am i making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals  where do they come from  the question came from the idea that i heard that morals come fromwhatever is societally mandatedits only one aspect of morality  societal morality is necessarilyvery crude and broadbrush stuff which attempts to deal with whatis necessary to keep that society going   and often its a littleoverenthusiastic about doing so  individual morality is a differentthing it often includes societal mores or society is in troublebut is stronger  for example some people are vegetarian though eatingmeat may be perfectly legalmerely a question for the basis of moralitymoralethical behavior  _societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_1who is societydepends on the societydoesnt help  is the point irrelevantno  often the answer is we are  but if society is those who makethe rules thats a different question  if society is who shouldmake the rules thats yet another  i dont claim to have the answers eitherbut i dont think we do it very well in ireland and i like some thingsabout the us system at least in principle2how do they define what is acceptabledependson  again this comes from a certain question see abovewell ideally they dont but if they must they should do it by consensus imo3how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral positionby adopting a default position that peoples moral decisionsare none of societys businessso how can we put people in jail how can we condemn other societiesbecause sometimes thats necessary  the hard trick is to recognise whenit is and equally importantly when it isnt and only interfering when its trulynecessarywhy would it be necessary  what right do we have to interfereimo it isnt often that interference ie jail and force of variouskinds and degrees is both necessary and effective  where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question  its a sort ofliars paradox force is necessary for freedom   one possible justificationis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldnt object iftheir own freedom is taken away  the paradox doesnt arise ifwe dont actively wish to take way anyones freedom  the introduction of permissible interference causes the problemthat it can be either too much or too little  but most people seemto agree that some level of interference is necessarythey see the need for a justice system  how can we even define that termonly by consensus i guess  thus youget a situation where the law often allows what honour forbids which ivecome to believe is as it should be  i admit i dont understand that statementwhat i mean is that while thusandsuch may be legal thusandsuch mayalso be seen as immoral   the law lets you do it but you dont let yourselfdo it  eating meat for example,0,atheism

yep thats pretty much it im not a jew but i understand that this is thejewish way of thinking however the jews believe that the covenant betweenyhwh and the patriarchs abraham and moses in this case establishes a moralcode to follow for mankind even the jews could not decide where the boundariesfall thoughas i understand it the sadducees believed that the torah was all that wasrequired whereas the pharisees the ancestors of modern judaism believed thatthe torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required morality in all its nuances talmudthe essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface betweenman and yhwh for a jew or christian and does not necessarily indicateanything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculatethe trouble with all of this is that we dont really know what the createdin his image means ive heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion this rather upsets the apple cart ifone wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphorsunashamedly as to living by christs example we know very little aboutjesus as a person we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historiansrevelation aside one can only know christ secondhand or worsethis is not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that wayinitially the point im trying to make is that we only really have the bibleto interpret and that interpretation is by humanity i guess this is wherefaith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectivenessno there may be an absolute moral code there are undoubtably multiplemoral codes the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar where there are no children the wrongness here is ifthe child disobeys the parent the parent may feel that it is inappropriateto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life butyou get the gist of it incidentally the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older see piaget and learns a morality of his owndavidon religion,19,misc
on the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same  john has described some of these  on the other hand some people seem to start tuning out the same old words and pay attention better when things get changed around  i think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us  it drives me crazy too different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy  my local parish is innovative  i prefer to go to mass at the next parish over  sometimes we dont have the option of attending a mass in the style which best suits us  john put a smiley on it but to just offer it up probably is the solutiona related issue that it sounds like john does not have to deal with is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes  my husband does like innovative litury  it is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways  when you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our childrens needs things get pretty complicatedone thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial mass is still mass,15,christian

working at this company for eight years in variousengineering jobs  im female  yesterday i counted and realized thaton seven different occasions ive been sexually harrassed at thiscompany  seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent onesomeone left an xrated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawerim really upset by this  i suppose it could have been worse  itcould have been a man having sex with a sheep or somethingthere was no note  i do not know if it was	 someones idea of an innocent joke that went awry	 someones sick idea of flirting	 an act of emotional terrorism that workedi dreaded coming back to work today  what if my boss comes in to askme some kind of question i dont know the answer so i take a militaryspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and outfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep  i generally have abible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up tocorinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy loveassociation  i want to throw up just thinking about this stuffi can lock up my desk but i cant lock up every book i have in theoffice  i cant trust that someone wont shove something into mybriefcase or my coat pocket when im not looking so that i go home tofind such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someonewants to do to my bodyto make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday totreat our marvelous secretary to lunch  the appointed hour forleaving was 1130  i was working in another building but wanted to goto the lunch  so i returned at 1125 only to find that ever singleperson had already left for lunch  they left at 1115 or so  no onecould be bothered to call me at the other building even though mynumber was posted  so i came back to a department that looked like aneutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor  this despitethe fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman beingleft in my desk draweri need some prayers  i cant stop crying i am so deeply woundedthat its ridiculousi feel like im some kind of subhuman piece of garbage for people toreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act  i feellike im a subhuman piece of garbage thats not worthy of a simplephone call saying were leaving for marys lunch a little early sothat bob can get back for a big 100 meetingplease pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculouslyturned into something positive  please pray that whoever is torturingme so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please prayfor my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of awhole slew of other wounds  please pray that i can find a new jobin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent suchharrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly actsappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions thiscompany in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassmentisnt tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that onefemale engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene orthreatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seventimes in eight years in the same place  pretty words from the companydo me no good when im terrified or healing from the latest assaultand please pray that i dont turn into an automaton because of thisthats my bad habit ignore it and it will go away youre not worthanyones time so dont go talking to anyone about this youre rightyou are a subhuman piece of garbage and deserve to be treated thisway you are just an object you prostitute your mind to thiscompany so why cant others expect you to prostitute your body there aswell what makes you think women arent just possessions andnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex actthis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a majordepressive episode please pray that these thoughts dont come intomy head and stay there triggering depressionplease pray that this latest trauma doesnt come between me and godin a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection togod and its also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that canseparate one mentally from god  i know god doesnt drop me from hisloving hand but its awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of thehand look down think im falling and forget that gods still holdingon to mealthough this probably isnt entirely appropriate for this newsgroupi really can use the kind of loving support you all provide  for thisreason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence  afterall hes allowed me the thermometer note and a few other offthewalltopicsthanks in advance to everyone for your support and prayers  peace to youesther,15,christian

hi everyone 	   im a commited christian that is battling with a problem  i knowthat romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yethebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you foolsdo you still think that just believing is enoughnow if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselvesand not by god according to romans that person is still saved by there faithbut then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold tohim ie doesnt know him  condemned so a lukewarm christian someone whoknows and believes in god but doesnt make any attempt to live by the biblenow i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you doas taught in romans but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of jamesin conjunction with the lukewarm christian being spatoutcan anyone help me this really bothers mein christwill,15,christian

jesus isnt god  when jesus returns some people may miss him   what version ofthe bible do you read mike jesus is god incarnate in flesh  jesus said i and the father are one jesus was taken up to heaven after his 40 day postresurrection stint and theangels who were there assured the apostles that jesus would return the same wayand that everyone will see the coming thats why jesus warned that many wouldcome claiming to be him but that we would know when jesus actually returns these are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve ,15,christian
