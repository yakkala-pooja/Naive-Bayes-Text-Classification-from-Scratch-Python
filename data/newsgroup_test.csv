 lots of stuff about the nicene creed deleted which can be read in the  original basenote  i will also leave it up to other lds netters to  take mr weiss to task on using mormon doctrine to declare the difinitive  word on what the lds church teaches as doctrine  hopefully the lds   netters will be amiable in their explanationsince it would do no good to rebut what mr weiss has stated on the originof the nicene creed and its status as devine and inspired i say no goodbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the creed were inspired i leave you it will be some time before i post again with the following thought authored by eugene england professor of english at brigham young university  mr england wrote the following as part of a book review section in this peoples magazine spring 1993 edition  i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon  or humanfamily until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other   with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative christian   or nonchristian  hal 8  when we are tempted to draw a circle around  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american then exclude  those who dont fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central  defining characteristic of a good american might be one who doesnt draw  exclusive circles  that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the   central american ideal is by excluding others  and when we are tempted to  draw a circle around mormon or christian to decide who is orthodox  and who isnt by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider  that the central pillar of christs orthodoxy is our ability to love  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family  i recently spent some time in a christian bookstore in california the  service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and  wellscrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural  commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons  but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking   others often viciouslywhether the political left our modern american  culture or other religions  a whole section was devoted to cults and the  occult and as you might expect mormonism was right there under the same  rubric and indictment often by the same authors as satanism  and i found  i could either rent or buy in english or spanish copies of the god makers  that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous  antimormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations  of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the 1930s  it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to  christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety perfect  love casteth out fear i john 418  i have always been pleased that the  lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though i find a   disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoatingand even threats of coercive  actionas the religious right wing has launched this year against the  political left and american cultural and religious styles they dont like  it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the  very people who have most slanderously attacked mormonspeople who would  if they had power forcefully restrict mormons rights along with those of  others they believe to be evilthe above sermon was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribeto this peoples magazine but would certainly apply to all of us whorely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into hisarms  even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospelas in the days of christ the church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the church  i for one do not wish to be labelled christian if those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream christianity would give it  once again being in the majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice is louder  thats really all the critics of the lds church have to standon in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the lds church interpretation  using someone elses biased research of truths and nontruths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves let us simply agree to disagree and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation thereby uplifting everyone  ,19,misc,soc.religion.christian

rick anderson replied to my letter withra in article ra just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinionsit may be irrelevant to you and your personal beliefs or should i saybias but it is relevant to me and many others  youre right thebottom line is truth independant from you or anyone else  since youproclaim truths as a selfproclaimed appointee may i ask you by whatauthority you do this  because it says so in the bible  does thebible say so or is it you or someone else who interprets whether ascripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapprovalexcuse moi but your line of truths havent moved me one bit to persuademe that my beliefs are erroneous  of all the preachers of truth onthis net you have struck me as a selfrighteous member of the wreckingcrew with no positive message to me or any other latterday saintbtw this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by jesusto the pharisees ye hypocrites    ye preach about me with your lipsbut your hearts are far removed from me also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grantsophistry  look whos talking jumping to conclusions  you wouldnt dothat yourself right  all you address is your own convictions regardlesswhether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our pointsof view because you reject such interpretations without any considerationwhatsoever the bible states that lucifer was created  the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the samea beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentationof lds doctrine  the former kgb would have loved to employ youjesus and lucifer are not the same silly and you know it the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of godcorrection it may contradict would you think the bible says  the bibleindeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that theybelong to or follow god in his footsteps  satan and his followers haverebelled against god and are not children followersredeemed of godbut it doesnt mean that they were not once created by god but chose toseparate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan ofsalvation        the field is the world the good seed are the children of the        kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one        matthew 1338kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesusand have shown works of repentance etc and the children of thewicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb  the issueof satans spiritorigin and of those who followed him has not

copyrighted thoughra  we are told that and this is life eternal that they might knowra  thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sentra  john 173 life eternal is to know the only true

true god whom you interpret according to your own likesand dislikes but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know abouthim myself  i guess your grandiose selfimage does not allow for otherfaiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a differentway or fashion than your own  not that it really matters the missionand progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mobor opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visitedevery continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear  this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but  rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read  something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teachessigh  what the bible teaches  or what the bible teaches according torobert weiss and co  i respect the former i reject the latter withoutthe remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus  on the contrary  and bythe way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant youbeing a christian following your own image of him as much as i am achristian following my own image of him in my heart  most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of  bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont  think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the  issue  were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this  subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may  certainly bethe issue is of course that you love to use anything to either misrepresent or ridicule the lds church  the issue of official doctrineis obviously very important  mcconkies views have been controversialeg the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic   at bestor erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in thisdispensation  i respect him as someone who has made his valuablecontribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personalinterpretations his book mormon doctrine is

summarizing mcconkiewas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom ofgod than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepteddoctrine some of it clearly belongs to

   you ask where we are  i would echo that question  im not trying to be   contentious  but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction   and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions   what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that   papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time   this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically   stood by the popethe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church  thisis the only thing that it is possible to resist a pope for hisdeparture from the traditional doctrine of the church  if commandsfrom any authority conflict with tradition the commands must bedisobeyedmy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a majorway  god would never allow a hairsplitting situation to develop itwould be too complex for people to figure out  i dont view thepresent situation in the church as anything extremely complicatedrun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in thecatholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast   it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is   disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over   authority and discipline  the problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholicfaith in my opinion  most catholics know about zilch about thecatholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erringbishops  its basically the reformation part iithere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects theshards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by thecatholic hierarchy  i could go on listing shocking things for anhour probablytake the situation in campos brazil for example  im reading a bookon what happened there after vatican council ii  the bishop antoniode castromayer never introduced all the changes that followed in thewake of vatican ii  he kept the traditional mass the same oldcatechisms etc  he made sure the people knew their faith thecatholic theology of obedience what modernism was etc  heinnoculated the people against what was comingwell one day the order came from rome for his retirement  it camewhen the pope was sick  bishop de castromayer waited until the poperecovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope reallywanted or something that some liberal had commanded in his absencethe pope confirmed the decision  so the good bishop retiredthe injustice that followed was completely incredible  a new bishopwas installed  he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castromayersclergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the newmass  the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new massthe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse  the bishopwas enraged by this  he usually resorted to enlisting the help ofthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church  thepriests would just start building new churches the people werecompletely behind them  the old parishes had the new mass as thebishop desired  and virtually no parishionersthe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according tocanon law  no priest can be penalized in any way for saying thetraditional mass because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius vnor is there any obligation to say the new massduring all this process the people of campos not just privateindividuals but including civil authorities were constantly sendingpetitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernistbishop  nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from romeeventually 37 priests were kicked out and about 40000 people   my question to the supporters of sspx is this	 is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms	 could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that	 the popes position does not change and that the leaders of sspx	 dont jointly make such  choice   if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority   if i adopt the view that im not wrong i cant be wrong and   theres no way ill change my mind you must change yours that   ive either left the catholic church or it has left meif the pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the endof the controversy  that process is all very well understood incatholic theology and anyone who doesnt go along with it is aninstant noncatholicthe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on inthe catholic world  if they knew the faith and what our bishops aredoing they would be shocked   we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real   traditional teaching of the church is  if this were a simple matter   east and west would not have been separated for over 900 yearsthis isnt the case in the catholic church  there is a massive bodyof traditional teaching  the popes of the last 150 years areespecially relevant  there is no question at all what the traditionaldoctrine is   i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term   i may be wrong here im not roman catholic thats heresy more or less  although they have done a great jobsince the reformation the last 30 years have seen so many errorsspread that its pitifulinfallibility rests in the pope and in the church as a whole  in theshort term a pope or large sections of the church can go astray  infact thats what usually happens during a major heresy largesections of the church go astray  the pope historically has beenmuch more reliable  everything will always come back in the longrun   what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement   regarding the sspx situation  would it be honored  if not how   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility   again im not trying to be contentions im trying to understand   since im orthodox ive got no real vested interest in the outcome   one way or the otheryes it would be honored  infallibility is infallibility  but whatis he going to define  that the new mass is a better expression ofthe catholic faith than the old  that sex education in the catholicschools is wonderful  that all religions are wonderful except forthat professed by the popes prior to vatican ii   it does if the command was legitimate  sspx does not view the   popes commands as legitimate  why  this is a very slippery slope,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

it is good to remember that every translation is to some extent aninterpretation so as you point out below one must really go back tothe original arabic  regarding the verses relevant to nature i preferto use dr maurice bucailles translations in his book the bible thequran and science for in general his translations are more literal maurice bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressingas each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motionalso note that the celestial bodies in the first translation quotedby you above is the translators interpolation  it is not existent inthe original arabic which is why it is included in brackets youre right what the verses _do_ contain isnt all that remarkablehowever dr bucaille a surgeon thats how hes a dr thinks it issignificant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas eventhough geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century  or soand this goes for the rest of the quran as well which has about 750verses or so regarding nature i think i remember reading once,0,atheism,alt.atheism

 deletion yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology  deletion  so no fun but i must have met the minority thenand given by god refers to any action whereby a godgod causes or better effects something  rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understandthat you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong butit appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysicsis different to that of the majority of jews while jewishtheology overall is quite distinct from the christianic godviews i have heard that it is possible for jews to attributeevil to their god an nono for christians the bible isstill seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man  deletion the context was metaphysics even when the process of adaptingthe commandments is not transcendent the justification of theprocess lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you breakout of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system  deletion is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among otherreprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it isfoul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passagesas an example for the content of the whole book  big deletion no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation ofthe bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean arguewith god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allowsyou to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theologic question is proof of a theology used   it is an important question in the light of what for instance thepassage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connectionbetween the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation ofit or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is hasone to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply writeother books that convey the message better you might answer that onecant becuase  some peculiar biblical information might be lost butthat holds true of every other book and the question remains why hasthe bible still a special place cant it be replaced somehow is itok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some othermessage that is included as well  deletion sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about ifone could not have a better system deletion if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands peopleto kill children for being idolaters and another where god killschildren directly what is more important to resolve the message thatchildren are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god  and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be importantin the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not itcan be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictionswith that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary wayand have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to somegod,0,atheism,soc.religion.christian

	typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed personthe bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years agoas were all of the holy books follow the parts that you think aresuitable for modern life ignore the others for heavens  sake donttake it literally					so you think it is easy to be a muslim or be a buddhistthe buddhas commandments are 500 yrs older than christs and inmy opinion tougher to follow moreover the buddha says that we are intrinsically good as against christs we are all sinners only we allow ourselves to be distracted by meditating we can awaken ourselves etc etc also there is no concept of god in buddhism in my opinion you can be an atheist and a buddhistbut to awaken yourself is no easy task can you stay away from eating meatcan you sit still and think of nothing meditate for sometime everydaybuddhists do or are supposed to can you pray five times a day can you fast for a month every year ramzan are you willingto give 16 th of your income as tithe muslims do in fact i think jesus was an ordinary man just as buddha and mohamed probably with a philosopy ahead of the times where he lived considering the fact that christianity is a young religioncompared to hindiusm judaism zorasterism buddihsm it is also veryprobable that the bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideasthere was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and themiddle east at the time of christand perhaps some more but leave the crap in it out woman was createdafter man to be his helper etcaras		when ever i turn on my tv there is this pat robertson andother brain washers oh boy what an act they put on with an1800 number to turn in your pledgesgod it seems is alive and well inside these boxes,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

im not surprised that you see no wisdom in them  that is because yourpremises are wrong from the word go  you claim that christianity isbased on blind faith but this simply is not so  just look at thecurrent thread on the evidence for jesus resurrection for evidencethat jesus was real and that he triumphed over deathfurthermore you say that christians hold to their beliefs regardless ofany evidence that you may find to the contrary  without any evidenceto support your claim this statement is little more than an ad hominem argumentmind you i dont mean this as a personal attack  im merely pointing outthe intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity in this fashionit would make much more sense if you could prove that all christians do base their belief on empty nothings and that they do ignore all evidence to the contrary  only then can you expect your attack to make sense ,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
i dont claim to be an expert on the branch davidians but i might know more than mostthe branch davidian group led by koresh is actually one of two offshoots of a group known as the shephards rod  the shephards rod now defunct as far as i knowbroke off from the sda church in the 30sthe shephards rod broke away from the sda church because they felt that the sda church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy  they felt that they were the remnant spoken about in revelationabout the koresh group koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988  once in control he made himself the center of it he proclaimed himself as christkoresh himself came from an sda background he was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church  after this he joined the branch davidiansthey wereare a survivalist cult this is why they had the stockpile of weapons food a bomb shelter etc  they had no intent of raiding the us government or anything they were preparing for armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position  in my opinion if the atf and the fbi had left well enough alone we wouldnt have the blood of 20 children crying out from the ashes in wacoif you want to know about the shephards rod you might want to visit the local sda church and talk to some of the older people  they could give you some insight into where koresh got his theology,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

a listmember d andrew killie i think wrote in response to thesuggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god  any god who works that way is indescribably evil  and unworthy of my worship or faithnobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others  where is your source of moral standards by which you judge gods  behaviorit is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge godsactions  who is the clay to talk back to the potter but we find acontrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of  suppose that there are some good men in the city  will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked  far be it from you lord to do such a thing  shall not the judge of all the earth do righti am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this andcan perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as  shame on you lord if you do such a thingthere are those who say that the definition of good is whatevergod happens to want but if that is so then the statement that godis good has no meaning  it simply says that god does what he wantsthat being the case no one can either love or obey god because heis good the only motive left for obeying him is that he ispowerful just as it makes sense to obey a dictator even when hetells you to round up all jews and exterminate them because if youdefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makessense to obey god because he has the power to punish you if youdont this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction togenesis 18 and to christianity in generalany theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes anyfurther discussion of morality or of the goodness of godmeaningless however it does not follow that our moral judgementsare always infallible in particular cases still less our judgementsin particular cases about the course of action most likely toachieve a good resultwhen i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god inhistory those actions often seem to me very different from what imight expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for usmoreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the naturalworld i find that nature is often very different from what i mightthose who believe that the author of nature is also the author ofthe scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sortof difficulties that they find in naturenow that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself anargument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of godon the contrary their absence would be such an argument supposethat i am watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that everytime he makes a move i find myself nodding and saying good movejust what i was expecting him to do  same move i would have made ifi were playing that would be a sign that fisher is no better achess player than myself given that he is better i expect that atleast some of his moves will have me thinking now what do supposeinduced him to do that or even boy that was a real slip  hesjust thrown the game away similarly if god understands theworkings of the universe better than i do it is to be expected thatsometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistakeone difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at thecontrols of the universe is that i can see the end of the chessgame if fisher wins i revise my earlier inference that it wascarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlierhowever if he loses and particularly if i can see that there was atime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and didnot take it then i know that he is not as good a player as i hadthoughtwith god on the other hand i shall not in this life see the totalresult of some of his actions therefore my grounds for judgingthat i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakierthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher                         in the book of genesis we read that josephs ten older brotherswho with good reason found  him insufferable conspired to sellhim into slavery in egypt there he eventually became viceroy andwhen there was a famine in canaan he was able to provide for hisfamily when his brothers nervously apologized he told them donot worry you meant to do me evil but god turned it into good        the history of the jews is largely a history of events   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued   survival of the religion or the people or both but   amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the jews   and of judaism        the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup   of the family  but in fact it ended with a reconciliation of   the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out   of canaan looked like a misfortune for them  but in fact if   they had stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have   intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into   their culture  their oppression by the egyptians a few   generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a   disaster but god used it to bring them out of egypt and into   the promised land        here the people built a temple and regularly offered   sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea   destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most of   the people to babylon you might have thought that that would   be the end of the people and the religion but it was not   living in canaan the people had been under constant danger of   assimilation  again and again they had turned from the   worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility   cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human   sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never   again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry   neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the   babylonians ever again had a foothold among them        nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becoming   simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances the only   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem   every so often and offering a sacrifice during the captivity   with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue a place   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the   scriptures they came to realize clearly what they were in   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea   that god is not simply a local or tribal deity not just the   controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish   people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge   of all humans everywhere        time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced by   that of the persians and then that of the greeks or rather   the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined   to stamp out judaism and to this end he made the reading and   the study of the torah punishable by death again one might   think that this would be the end of judaism but it was not   the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah   portion appointed for the day they would read some passage   from the prophets that had a similar theme and then discuss   that  before this time the torah the socalled five books of   moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue  if it   had not been for antiochus the books of the prophets would   probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism   saved them        other examples here omitted for brevitys sake        some of you may remember that julie andrews first became   famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair   lady when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it   everyone expected that julie who had been so magnificent on   stage would play the same role in the movie instead the   studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast   audrey hepburn  julie andrews was naturally crushed but she   later realized that if she had played the screen role she   would have been typecast for life as an elize doolittle type   it would have been a disaster for her as it was walt disney   offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for   it  at the presentation she stood there smiling and looking   at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the   man who made all this possible  jack warner it was the most   memorable line of the evening        in a similar spirit we jews might thank the men who in   the providence of god have preserved judaism and kept it alive   to this day beginning with josephs brothers and continuing   with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus   epiphanesafter the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to himprivately and said you were talking about the holocaust werentyou he answered if that is an example that came to your mindthen you are right i was talking about it to you but i would nottalk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it i assumethat he meant that without the holocaust there would have been nostate of israelsomeone hearing the rabbis lecture might leap to the conclusionthat god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish hispurposes  or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then  goon to suppose that the wickedness is in fact gods doing  that hestirred up josephs brothers to a murderous hate against him andthat when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaohsheart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them goand this raises questions about how an action can be consideredwicked and at the same time be considered something that god hasbrought abouti suggest another way of looking at it consider a sculptor who hasa log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue but the loginstead of having a smooth even grain throughout has a large knotthat spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor considersthe wood for a while and then carves a statue that features theknot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and colorof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so thatobservers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding apiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place itspresence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue agreat work of art in reality the knot far from being what the sculptor waslooking for was a challenge to his skill if the wood had notcontained that flaw he would still have made a great work of artbut a different one so if josephs brothers had not sold him godwould still have brought about his purposes for the jewish peoplebut he would have done so in another manner if judas had notbetrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejectedjesus but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god ifpilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had setjesus free it might appear that there would have been nocrucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore nosalvation not so god did not need judas sin to redeem us ifjudas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciledthe world to himself  we do not know how just as we do not knowhow michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if itsinterior had instead been shaped like grand central station andjust as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourthgame agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishopsand had attacked fishers knight instead dont bother to look upthe game in questioni am making up this example but the point isnone the less validthus we may say both 1 that god used say the cowardice ofpilate to accomplish his purposes and 2 that the said cowardicewas not gods doing and that pilate would not have thwarted godsplans by behaving justly and courageouslywhat then are we to make of the place where god says to moses iwill harden pharaohs heart so that he will not let the people gosome christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppetwith god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and crueltywere not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose ratherthat what god was telling moses was something like this if you seethat pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not bediscouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control mypurposes will not be thwarted if pharaoh chooses to hear you andlet the people go well and good if he does not i will fit hisresistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that futurehistorians and theologians will suppose that i would have beenthrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed meto return to the question that started this all off is it possiblethat the serbs in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia areinstruments of gods will     first point what they are doing is wrong just as whatjosephs brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrongthey intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it thatdoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation andpunishment     second point of course god will bring good out of it but notthe same good that he would have brought if the serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does thegood he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
and that of course is the point   you cant simply divide theworld into atheists and nonatheists on the basis of godbeliefif all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity andhave nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernaturalbeing is your criterionbut once you start talking about behaviour then someones susceptibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are  i assume  worried aboutand in that area what you care about is whether someone is scepticalcritical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable andeasily led on the otheri would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicatesthat a person is easily led   whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to bebeside the point,0,atheism,soc.religion.christian

mr decenso in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judasrejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrasesthose scholars opinion on the subjectand actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you willfind that it does denote success  those scholars did indeed have an excellentreason to assume that the suicide was successful  as i pointed out irecently checked several lexicons	greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida	robinsons greek and english lexicon of the new testament	greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm	word study concordance tynsdale	a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other 	 early christian writings bauerarndtgingrich	the new analytical greek lexicon perschbachera couple simply stated hanged oneself and a couple were more explicit and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging acouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw isstrangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy whosuggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down  one of the bestreferences though robinsons greek and english lexicon of the newtestament not only stated the translation it gave both the root words theliteral translation related greek words which use the same roots and alsoother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to givefurther context  the word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root andthe root word apo means literally away this root words is included inwords which denote a transition  it can mean a transition in place eg thegreek word apagello means to send a message  apo can also denote achange in state and specifically the change from life to death  robinsonspecifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo which means to killin literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle strangle to put outof the way and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away fromlife to death  so while the word apacgw does mean to hang itspecifically denotes a death as well  thus robinson is quite specific when hestate that it means to hang oneself to end ones life by hanging he thennotes the the use of apacgw in homers odessy 19230 to denote context  hepresents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide byhanging now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling without theadded denotation of death and as you insist that the bible was written bygod and every word is precicely correct you are stuck with the completemeaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw was used then death isdenoted as the result by the way i note that mr decenso also presents an example of apacgwnote mr decenso as you say the septuagint was a translation from hebrew togreek and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew ie the thehebrew say and died and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek it should also be pointed out that regardless of the added and died thecorrect translation would still be apacgw as the man did indeed die fromstrangulation redundant but correct  further we have evidence that theseptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versionswhich contradicted each other and such editing was not even necessarilyexecuted by greeks  thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as itnow stands as a paragon of ancient greek  so what you really need to proveyour point mr decenso is an example in ancient greek of someone committingapacgw and surviving  otherwise i would see you as simply making worthlessassertions without corresponding evidence now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research itone of your apparently contrived exegisis i pretty much find it false  thusi think that if you are going to add to the text something over and abovewhat the source clearly says then you had better have an explicit greek orhistorical source to justify it by the way as to mr roses statement about trees around the potters fieldunless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old or thatthere are 2000 year old stumps there or has a 2 thousand year old descriptionof the area which mentions such trees then it is inappropriate for him toassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees twothousand years ago after all things change now as to your other argument ie that the money judas used is not the sameas the 30 silverstrue peter or the author of acts does not specifically call judas betrayalan iniquity but for that matter neither does john specifically call judasactions an iniquity either  further john 1329 did not say that judas took    some thought that because judas had the money box jesus was telling     him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something     to the poor so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out and     it was nightnote that it is said that judas left it does not say that he took the moneybox  thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choosethe a an unproven iniquity mentioned by another author in a differentbook written at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mentioned bythe author of acts  i find this forced and contrived of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have seenevidence that apacgw means suicide  you see since judas hanging wassuccessful he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 1329 becausematthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day iepassover and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himselfthe next day  thus the money which bought the field of blood would have tohave been the 30 pieces of silver of course he got the 30 pieces of silverthat night as well and thus couldnt have spent that either  oh dear ibelieve that the house of cards is comming down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether jesus was crucified onfriday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judasby the way as to where the prophesy of the potters field came from ie themention of it in matthew you sayi am reminding you now to discuss it now its all part of the same verse weare discussing and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues

heres the life of st maria goretti posted with kind permission ofthe editor of the australian catholic magazine morning starhope you like it    put up with anything to prevent sin st maria goretti    maria was born on october 16th 1890 to luigi and assunta goretti    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven she was a cheerful    girl always imitating her parents  she had but one disire  but    one wish to receive our lord in the blessed sacrament    the date was finally set for little maria to receive our lord  on    the feast of corpus christi for maria time seemed like an eter    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day   when  it  finally    arrived fr jerome the priest who was to celebrate the mass and    give the children their first holy communion delivered a  sermon    on	the  immense love of jesus christ for them and the great love    we should have in return for him he then warmly  urged  them  to    die rather than commit a mortal sin    maria humbly approached the altar of god and  received  the  holy    eucharist	her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her fathers    absence who died some time beforehand as for the	rest  of  the    day  maria remained under the spell of the divine visit that is    until				   4    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to holy communion    thus ended the happiest day of marias life    over the next twelve months maria had changed  from  a  giggling    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities as her    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband	maria    took  on the ironing cooking washing and other motherly duties    she was doing this not only for her own family but also for  the    serenellis a father and son who lived with the gorettis owning    a share in the farm although maria was poorer than all the other    children she by far surpassed them in virtue in all thi ngs she    did the holy will of god    during the month of june  alessandro  serenellithe  son	twice    made advances upon maria when he chanced to be alone with her on    both occasions maria managed to  struggle  free  of  alessandros    strong  grip but on the second he threatened to kill her if she    even uttered a word to her mother from this day on maria	lived    in terror fearing lest alessandro attack again    on july 5th 1902 alessandro left work in the fields  to  get  a    handkerchief  as	he  claimed he went to the storeroom beneath    the house where maria who was outside on the  landing  with  the    baby  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools she wondered    what he was doing it was later learned that he was sharpening  a    912  blade he went to the house and called for maria she told    him she wouldnt go to him unless she knew why she was needed he    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room mar ia    instantly realized what he was up to no no no do  not	touch    me  it  is a sin you will go to hell at this point alessandro    held the knife over marias chest who was now on the floor    will you or will you not maria gathered all her energy	no i    will  not	alessandro  no   she had chosen her martyrdom over    sin god over satan  overcome with rage alessandro plunged  the    knife  into   marias  breast fourteen times  finally he came to    his senses and thought maria was dead  frantically he threw  the    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room  the crying    of the baby teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to    assunta  and the father of alessandro as the baby was unattended    and was in danger of falling off they ran to the house  to  find    maria  who  covered in blood was dragging herself to the door    when asked what happened she said alessandro  stabbed  her   he    wanted to make me do wrong and i would not    the ambulance arrived then the police who took alessandro	away    as	the  ambulance	carried  maria to the hospital a large crowd    followed on foot  the doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for    poor  little maria  the same fr jerome who gave maria her first    communion				   5    came to administer the last rites and to give her holy  viaticum    he asked maria if she would forgive her murderer  yes  for the    love of jesus i forgive him  i wish for him to one day  join  me    in	paradise   may  god forgive him for i alread y have maria    died at about three oclock    alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  marias  death  but    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in    prison  after eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show    ing  no regret for his crime he saw in a dream in the  midst of    a field of flowers maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to    him  soon later he wrote to the local bishop begging gods par    don for the grave sin he had committed  he later gave  testimony    in	marias  beatification in 1947  less than three years later    on ju ne 24th 1950 maria was canonised  assunta goretti was the    first mother ever to be present at her daughters canonisation    may st maria goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin    saint maria goretti pray for us    by brendan arthur,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

can a theist be truly objective  can he be impartial     when questioning the truth of his scriptures or     will he assume the superstition of his parents     when questioning ive often found it to be the case that the theist     will stick to some kind of superstition when     wondering about god and his scriptures  ive     seen it in the christian the jew the muslim     and the other theists alike  all assume that     their mothers and fathers were right in the     aspect that a god exists and with that belief     search for their god     occasionally the theist may switch religions or     aspects of the same religion but overall the     majority keep to the belief that some creator     was behind the universes existence  ive     known muslims who were once christians and vice     versa ive known christians who were once     jewish and vice versa and ive even known     christians who become hindu  yet throughout     their transition from one faith to another     theyve kept this belief in some form of higher     being  why     it usually all has to do with how the child is     brought up  from the time he is born the     theist is brought up with the notion of the     truth of some kind of scripture the bible     the torah the quran  etc  he is told     of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired     the scripture of the prophets talked about in     the scripture of the miracles performed  etc     he is also told that to question this as     children are apt to do is a sin a crime     against god and to lose belief in the scrip     tures truth is to damn ones soul to hell     thus by the time he is able to read the     scripture for himself the belief in its truth     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a     matter of course     but it doesnt stop there  once the child is able     to read for himself there is an endeavor to     inculcate the child the right readings of     scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant     readings to gloss over the worse ones and to     explain away the unexplainable with mystery     circular arguments selfevdent facts and     truths unreasoning belief and fear of     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat     of every day  to doubt of course means wrath     of some sort and the child must learn to put     away his brain when the matter concerns god     all of this has some considerable effect on the     child so that when he becomes an adult the      superstitions hes been taught are nearly     impossible to remove     all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can     truly be objective when questioning god hell     heaven the angels souls and all of the rest     can he for a moment put aside this notion that     god does exist and look at everything from     a unbiased point of view  obviously most     theists can somewhat especially when presented     with mythical gods homeric roman egyptian      etc  but can they put aside the assumption     of gods existence and question it impartially     stephen    ____  ____   _       _     atheist   _        _    _   _ _ _ _      libertarian  ____  ____   _   _  _       proindividuality       _  _     _  _       _        proresponsibility____  _      _ _       _ jr     and all that jazz ,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

	first i want to start right out and say that im a christian  it makes sense to be one  have any of you read tony campollos book liar lunatic or the real thing  i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book  anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himselfsounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy  just what organization did he belong to does it have a name	the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy  a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he waslogic alert  artificial trifercation  the are many other possible explainations  could have beenthat he never existed  there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible  that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind	some reasons why he wouldnt be a liar are as follows  who would die for a lie  wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar  people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed  call me a fool but i believe he did heal people  logic alert   argument from incredulity  just because it is hard for you to believe this doesntmean that it isnt true  liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself sitehe has followers that dont think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to dieby not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes  as far as healing goes  if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is notconsistent between the different gospels  in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today  seems to me that the early gospels werent that compelingso the stories got bigger to appeal better	niether was he a lunatic  would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy  very doubtful in fact rediculous  for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away	therefore since he wasnt a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing  or might not have existed or any number of things  that is the logical pitfall that those whouse flawed logic like this fall into  there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid becausein the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible  once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternativeshowever if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices  i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isnt one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid	some other things to note  he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone  this in his betrayal and crucifixion  i dont have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use itjc was a rabbi  he knew what those prophecies were  it wouldnt be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy  what would be compeling is if therewere a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then  yet fullfilled them anyway	i dont think most people understand what a christian is  it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches  rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for gods sake  he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same  hey we cant do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him  thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time  we dont rush it in one day christianity is your whole life  it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while  we box everything into time units  such as work at this time sports tv social life  god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves  here i agree with you  anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life  i have very little respect for xians that dont  if the myth is true then it is true in its entirity  the picking and choosingthat i see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouthjim	  james l felder			sverdrup technologyinc	     phone 2168914019nasa lewis research center     	    cleveland ohio  44135         	     email jfelderlercnasagov some people drink from the fountain of knowledge other people gargle,0,atheism,alt.atheism

  bill i find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what isprobably the weakest evidence  what is probably the most convincing is the antichristian literature put outby the jewish councils in the second century  there are enormous quantities ofdetailed arguments against christianity many of the arguments still being usedtoday  despite volumes of tracts attacking christianity not one denies theexistance of jesus only of his activities  i find this considerably more compelling than josephus or the harmony of thegospels especially considering that matthew and luke probably used mark as asource,19,misc,soc.religion.christian
hello  firstly what do you exactly mean by fundamentalist  i willfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believesthat the bible is gods word to mankind  i suspect that what happenedto him is what hell call being born again  anyway was that recentif the answer is yes to all the questions above it is quiteunderstandable  however imo ild rather give advice to your friendi think ive been through something similar to him and one thing i cansay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying tocommunicate from different worldviews  why he talks about those thingsis because they are now obvious to him  what is obvious to him isnot obvious to you  secondly why he may be very persuasive is becausefrom his point of view he has been on both sides of the fence  thisi mean that before he turned fundamentalist you two are agreeablebecause both of you see things from the same side  if suddenly as ifa new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him it is like thediscovery of lets say a new continent or a new planet  to him hesgot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful thanwhere he was and what he thinks is much better than where you are nowyou have got to realise that from his point of view he means well toyou eventhough he may end up offending you  to him it is worth thatrisk  nevertheless it is really up to him to respect where you standand listen to you as well  at this moment it may be difficult becausehe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet abouthowever he may not realise that hes really putting you offso far ive only been trying to explain things from his side  howeveri do understand how you feel too because i wasnt a christian for a goodpart of my life as well  i was quite turned off by christians orfundamentalists who were really all out and enthusiastic about theirfaith  they really scared me to tell you the truth  unfortunatelyreligious belief is a very personal thing just as your agnosticismis also a very personal thing to you  since the christian belief isinevitably at odds with anything nonchristian religious or otherwiseit will be a touchy matter  like all friendships it will take bothsides to do their part to make it work  in this matter maybe you cando your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what hestrying to convince you about that its beyond you or not your concernfor now  dont tell him its nonsense because to him it is reality and that would be a real insult  hell also have to be careful not toinsult where you stand toolike i said before i wish i could give your friend some advice tooill admit that i did similarly to some of my friends when i became achristian  in some ways i wish i could have done things a littledifferently  however it was difficult then because i was so excitedand just blabbered away about what ive found  to me it was too goodnot to know  to some i was crazy and i didnt really care most ofthe time what they thought  you will probably think hes crazy too but god is very real to him as real as you are to him  keep that inmind  and he thinks he can convince you because since god is so realto him he doesnt see why god cant be real to you tooi dont know how helpful this is to you  but all the best anyhow this is quite a challenge for you to face  by the way personalconviction nobody is beyond saving except the one we call the devil and his hosts,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

 and many others mailed me  here is a reply to one of the letters  seems tome that atheist do not like the doctrine of hellyour using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers  of coursein your termonology god could not cease to exist  however that is not whatdeath ever means in the scriptures  if you will study the word you will seethat it signifies separation  death is separation not ceastation  this isthe reason for the agony of the cross  for the first time in eternity onemember of the godhead was separated from the other two  i once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined  she was to become mygirlfriend for several years  however having been drafted we wereseparated by distance  to me that was a form of death  later she decidedthat she couldnt wait for me to come home and bid me adue  that to me wasdeath  it was separation from that which had made me whole  death isseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship notbecause he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to gothere  when i rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me  i found no wisdom inthat until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children  hewas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continuedon my suicidal course  he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh andunloving  if god warns of impending danger that is love  if choose to let usdo as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses toyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear  this may give light to the error of your understanding  one must have correctknowledge in order to have correct faith  faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life  as the scripture sayheb 415 for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with ourweaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet withoutsinthe kenosis passage of phil 2 states that he gave up his godhead attributeswhen he took upon himself humanity  it has been a favorite meditation of mineto think about this  it was to be my phd thesis  the consciousness ofchrist  i have talked at length with a great many people about thisinteresting study including clh  it is my conclussion that as jesus the 2nd member of the trinity actuallysuffered as we do  he became part of the human race and experienced it as wedo  he grew in knowledge  he chose not to grasp his omniscience but choseto be taught  it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to suchan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man andjesus as god  but in jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before himthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is he was not aware that this event was to take place in time  he wasliving sequential history as you or i  maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussionand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often thannoti was once a member of that club  the free thinker is a glorious ideal  bycontrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repositoryof everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive  i findsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd   if the liberal humanistwishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rationaldoubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith  he must acknowledge thatwhile it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize thechristian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticizehim as a humanist  if there is no faith there can be no dout  there is nofaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faithpascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few  speak dubiously of scepticism  the fact that skeptics are notskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we mustbelieve in something else  the person who is skeptical toward one faith oreven most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another  in fact it is ameasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can definehimself only in negative terms hence the term atheistsome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism  inmy campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember however they disproved their own argument with every thought every wordevery point of logic that they used  every moment of shared communicationspeaks against their total skepticism  their very insistence of trying to makesense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silentthat is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticismis arbitrary  next time youre in a room of skeptics yell out look your flyis undone  each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what hebelieves without skepticism  to stress this is to belabor the obvious but itunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what heknows  pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing one which is based onpresuppositions  but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed beforeit is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt andcritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objectiveand neutral  in other words another myth  presuppositions my friend  it is impossible to doubt anything unless there issomething we do not doubt our own assumptionspresuppostions  even these canbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions  presuppostitons areour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken forabsenceof course that is hardly an original statement  milton coined it but it hadbeen in use for millenia  it was even used in the first highlander movie but again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character ofgod  you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistictheology not what he has revealed of himself through history through hisprophets through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son  if youare to reject gods annointed savior then reject him from a correctunderstanding of himself,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

i dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned     and the trumpet had blowni dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment     before the white throneoh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fatethey cried for the rock and the mountainsthey prayed but their prayers were too latethe soul that had put off salvation not tonight ill get saved by and by no time now to think of  religion alas he had found time to dieand i saw a great white thronenow some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good formotivation yet jesus thought it was  paul thought it was  paul said knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade mentoday too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some ofit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship  we dont tell people anymore thattheres such a thing as sin or that theres such a place as hell  as jayne has said this doesnt mean we have to come on so strong so as to hitpeople over the head with a baseball bat  yet the fact remains there is aplace called hell  a place so fearful that god died to save us from having toexperience it  whatever you or i as christians do we should do whatever wecan to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from goingto outer darkness  jesus in mt 25 tells us that he didnt prepare hell for people  he preparedit for the devil and his angels  no where in the bible do i read anywherethat god predestined anybody to go to hell  dl moody use to say that theelect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wonts whether or not thats theologically sound i couldnt defend but itspractical  jesus said to the people of israel ye would not  now some of you may not be students of the bible heck some of you may not bechristians  have you ever said to somebody i dont believe in hell  ibelieve in the religion of jesus  but did you know that jesus talked moreabout hell than he did about heaven  oh i believe in the religion of thesermon on the mount  you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on themount  youll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire several times he talks about hell and about judgment  in fact over and overin the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talks about hell  not isaiah not moses  not john the baptist though he did but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and didntwant to see them go therenow if there is no hell then jesus preached in vain  it was our lord jesusnot some angry baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies andwhere the fire never goes out  jesus said that  it was jesus who called hella furnace of fire  it was jesus that used the word condemnation  andthis is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light becausetheir deeds are evil  jesus said that  how can we get it across to you that a loving dying jesus preached about hell not only that but he went through hell  thats what calgary was all about when my lord was on the cross darkness fell  he called hell outerdarkness  do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling overhere the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes areprostituting their bodies over there  thats not what hell is  hells not aparty  theres no fellowship there  he called it outer darkness  outeraway from god  darkness god is light  no when he was on the cross he was made sin for you and for me  god treatedjesus the way sinners have to be treated  thats is a sobering thought  as myson would say an awesome thought  my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  hell is isolation  theres nofellowship in hell  theres no friendship in hell  theres no loving embracein hell  theres no hand shake in hell  theres no word of encouragement inhell  i thirst  it goes much deeper than physical thirst  hell is eternal cravingwith no satisfaction  the man whose life was lived for drugs will crave iteternally  the man whose life was lived for the lust of a womans body willcrave it eternally and not be satisfied  one theologian has put it this wayand i think it deserves merit  what is hell  hell is just the kind ofenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost  in a recent post i was trying to remember the founder of the word of lifeministries  ive remembered his name jack wertzen and found that theillustration that i gave wasnt his  his illustration was that he was talkingto his barber and his barbers wife and daughter had just recently been savedand he was commenting about it to jack  they sing these songs and read bibleverses and their praising this and that i cant stand it  jack do you thinkgod would send me to hell  jack answered by saying yes i think he would of course the barber said what do you mean by that  well if you cantstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises togod now what would you do in heaven where theyll do it for eternity  youdbe miserable  because god loves you hed put you where it would match whatyou really are   it makes a man thinkthe crucifixion of jesus christ is a fact that necessitates the eternalexistence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act  dont askme how i dont know  but he is god and he is the infiniteeternal and when hedied he died an infiniteeternal death  it is by that eternal act that hepurchased eternal life for the whosoever wills  he suffered eternaljudgment  a lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying everybody is goingto be saved eventually  universalism  my bible says no hell separatethem  the sheep from the goats  after you die theres a probationary periodin which god prepares you for heaven  no my bible says that it is appointedunto men once to die and then comes judgment  some of the cultist believe inannihilation  after you die sssswish  just like a mosquito youre squishedout  no in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just asthere is in heaven  i dont enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you dont enjoylistening to them but we have to preach the entire word of god  there is aplace called hell  if i could give one verse of scripture that could give anyhope that people arent going there id give it to you but i havent foundit  that fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our god is agod of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he has made us the kind ofcreatures we are and therefore were responsible the fact that he has placedus in a universe that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin issuch an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save usfrom hell leads us to two applications1  as ive already mentioned  if you are a christian you must worn others its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that justaround the bend the bridge is out  knowing therefore the terror of lord wepersuade men2  if you havent accepted jesus are your savior youre taking an awfulchance  as i say to the jehovah witnesses who no longer frequent my door ifyou are right and i am wrong then i will have lived a good life and will

   there may be some misunderstanding over terms herei agree  quite likely actually                                                      i believe jesus   only originally was in the context of baptism  these are folks who   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only   jesus rather than father son and holy spirit  this may have   doctrinal implications but as far as i know it does not mean that   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father  im not the   right one to describe this theology and in fact i think there may be   several including what would classically be called monophysite or   arian two rather different views as well as some who have beliefs   that are probably consistent with trinitarian standards but who wont   use trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply   because it is not biblical  clhnot biblical  what then can they make of the end of matthew2818and jesus came and said to them all authority in heaven and onearth has been given to me 19go therefore and make disciples of allnations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son andof the holy spirit 20 and teaching them to obey everything that ihave commanded to you  and remember i am with you always to the endof the age other ancient authorities add amen nrsvthe notes give no sense that this is emended  do other textscontradict this regarding baptism  or is a misunderstanding of thetrinity the most likely explanation after allbut maybe i simply misunderstand their views  is anyone else out thereforced to read this group with both a good bible and an unabridgeddictionary  christianity really is an education in itselfarrgggghhhh  when i talked about people who rejected trinitarianlanguage as unbiblical i was speaking of trinitarian theology thingslike one essense and three persons  obviously the threefoldbaptismal formula is biblical as you point out  i normally use theterm threefold in referring to mat  while it is certainlyconsistent with belief in the trinity the trinity is a doctrine whosefull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th cents  its unlikelythat mat had in mind the fullydeveloped trinitarian doctrineindeed the threefold baptismal formula is used by some groups that donot believe in the trinity  the disagreement over baptismal formulaeoccurs because of passages such as acts 238 which command baptism inthe name of jesus  there are a couple of other passages in acts aswell  this leaves us with sort of a problem were commanded in matto baptize in the name of the father the son and the holy spiritand in acts to baptize in the name of jesusjesus only groups baptize in the name of jesus  they consider thisconsistent with mat 2818 because they say that jesus is the name ofthe father the son and the holy spirit  im not the right one toask to explain what this means  i will simply say that it does notappear to be normal trinitarian theology  it is also an odd way ofdealing with the idiomatic phrase in the name ofthose who use the threefold formula dont seem to have a standardanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of jesusi suspect that the most common explanation is to say that in the nameof need not be a verbal formula  to say that you baptize in the nameof jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under jesusauthority  in the 1st cent context it contrasts christian baptismwith the baptism of john or other jewish baptism  of course theres acertain parallelism between these passages  that suggests that wecould just as well say that mat 2818 doesnt require the specificthreefold formula to be used in baptism but simply characterizesbaptism done by those who follow the father son and holy spiritone might well suspect that in the early church more than onebaptismal formula was used  so long as we consider following jesus tobe the same as following the father son and holy spirit no greatdamage would be done by such a difference  this does not mean thati think we should go back to using both formulae  baptism is one ofthe few things that almost all christian groups now recognizemutually so i do not think doing something to upset that would be inthe interests of the gospel  this is reinforced by the fact thatthose groups that actually use in the name of jesus now do seem tohave in mind a difference in doctrine  but as ive said before imnot the one to explain what their doctrine is,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
okay i argued this thoroughly about 34 weeks ago  men and women aredifferent  physically physiologically and psychologically  muchrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex byanne moir and david jessel  i recommend you find a copy and read ittheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topicand is well referenced now if women and men are different in some ways the law can onlyadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they aredifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and womenare different  maternity leave is an example of this  it takes intoaccount that women get pregnant  it does not give women the same rulesit would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in thisinstance would be unjust  this is just simply an obvious example ofwhere men and women are intrinsically differentnow people make the _naive_ argument that sexism  oppressionhowever maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the sameextent or degree and therefore it is sexist  no matter however much aman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can  andtherefore the law is sexist  no man can have access to maternity leaveno matter how hard he tries to get pregnant  i hope this is clearmaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because thesexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and womendifferent  there are many other differences between men and women whichare far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these irecommend you have a look at the book brainsexyour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallaciousif men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologicallybecome women  to have a womb and the other factors required forpregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious  youare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women  which actually just supportsmy statement that maternity leave is sexistthere is no official priesthood in islam  much of this function istaken by islamic scholars  there are female islamic scholars andfemale islamic scholars have always existed in islam  an example fromearly islamic history is the prophets widow aisha who was recognizedin her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholaryou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions andi dispute it  i could go on and on about women in islam etc but irecently reposted something here under the heading islam and women if it is still at your newssite i suggest you read it  it is repostedfrom socreligionislam so if it has disappeared from altatheism itstill might be in socreligionislam i forgot what its original titlewas though  i will email it to you if you like your statement that other religions are no different is i think astatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other thanchristianity and perhaps judaismaisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but alsowas at one stage a military leaderthe prophets first wife who died just before the hijra theprophets journey from mecca to medina was a successful businesswomanlucio you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when yourviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions,0,atheism,alt.atheism

golgotha the whole process of the fall of manthis was precisely my point  from a theological bent those who livedimmediately after the flood such as noah ham his son cush and his sonnimrod had a much stronger appreciation of divine wrath  they also had astronger understanding of the true god  in fact this immediacy was a cause ofhardship for some so much so that atlas who is seen with heavens resting onhis shoulders  but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance andthus he became the elevator of the heavens  this god made men able tofeel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the god of heaven could notsee through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers ofhis laws  it is interesting to see that it was that was titled emancipatoror deliverer  or phoroneus it was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal systemand abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given manybenefits  he was a deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as adeliverer  one delivered from a conscious feeling of gods wrath the otheractually performed a delivery from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept itas truei dont see the problem  from the time of adam those who looked forward tothe coming anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it was god whowas to do the provision were accounted as righteous  but up to thecrucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away  therefore thedispensation of the church views the accountability of sin the same but see itas a completed action  roms makes it clear that it has always been salvationvia faith and nothing elsei understand what youre trying to convey but i dont think id lay hold of itbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with theeternality of say the church ruling with christ  jn 17 tells us what eternallife is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than noncessation ofconsciousness  it depends upon your def of lost  the elect were lost only in time asoutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in christ andtherefore never assuredly lost  maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it  i simplyhave to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive either that or countless trips to the oriental museumcouldnt agree with you more  our understanding of say eschatology isclearly clearer than that of say isaiah  but that is not what i was referringtono i understand it as you have said this was my pointah  this is it  this is the big question  however i would say again ithink that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satans twist of gods word when he coerced eve  that is a veryinteresting study the similarity in the midst of great variety ofyes that is my point  but it is a two edged sword for some do not want theunderlying reality to be revealed  they were not known as mystery religionsfor no reason  there was the public side of them and there was the privateside that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if theyrevealed that private side  that is why it is so hard to bring their teachingsto light the mystery of iniquity that we find in the bible correlates tothis i think  the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privatelylittle by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it wouldnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion  case in pointtoday might be the masons  just a note that they too worshipped osiris inegypt who can be traced to nimrod the husband sonno i disagree with you here gerry  i know what youre alluding to in that thechurch primarily the rcc did endorse aristotelian philosophy into theirworldview but i would disagree with you that it originated in greece  if youare a student of history you will come to see that much of what greece came toexpound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that whichthey had taken from conquered countries  the soul is clearly mentioned anddiscussed at length in the egyptian religions as was the unity of god and alsothe trinity of god  see if you can find wilkinsons egyptians  he reallydoes a number on what the greeks did to what they pilfered from theegyptians im not knocking aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker  its just thatthere is nothing new under the sun,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

i will answer this as i find timenotice what i said about this book  i called it easy reading  the reason idropped philosphy as my major was because i ran into too many pharisaicalsimons  i dont know how many walking encyclopedias i ran across inphilosphy classes  the problem isnt in knowing sooooo much more than youraverage lay person the problem comes when you become puffed up about it schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person  that was who he waswritting to  i suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel wasto simple  ive talked with schaeffer one on one  ive been in lectures withthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and profs from secularas well as christian universities nd alone would fill both those catagories his answers were enough that the profs themselves often were taken back andcaused to rethink what their question was  i saw this time and time again atdifferent open forums  so yes schaeffers books are by in large wellsimplistic  it certainly isnt grad level reading  but we must get off ourhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading  do you seriously think mostpeople would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein  i may have more tosay about this secular scientist at another timealso one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistentinquisitiveness  one cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubtbase  look the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality  but we mustadd a qualification to give this balance  christianity is second to none inkeeping reason in its place  we never know the value of a thing until we knowits limits  put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaustit of all valuethis is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not christianfaith which leads to irrationality  if we forget the limits of a thing wefly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironiclesson of life more without limits is less  less with limits is more  or as i have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form wofreedomlets put it another way  the rationality of faith is implacably opposed toabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery think about that  it can tell thedifference between the two if you will let it  christianitys contention withrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has verylittle else  when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trustgo hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be calledto go on by itself without his understandingthis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies  at such time if thechristian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgmentand say father i do not understand you but i trust you  now dont read allyour objections of me into that statement  i wasnt saying i do not understandyou at all but i trust you anyway it means that i do not understand you inthis situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway  therefore i cantrust that you understand even though i do not the former is a mysteryunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity  the latter isa statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery offaith  so the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational  it isnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith  as believers we cannot always knowwhy but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes allthe differencenow there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where i have partedcompany with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bitmore difficult in practice  in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faithlike the insistent whying of a 3 year old  it isnt just that we would liketo know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannotknow  the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the otherleads to genuine anguish  more specifically the poorer our understanding is incoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything aftercoming to faith  if we do not know why we trust god then we will always needto know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him  failing to graspthat we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand maycount decisevely against what we are able to trust  if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trusthim in situations where we do not understand what he is doing too many xianleaders teach as if the christian had a window in the back of his head whichallows for understanding at every foot fall  for what god is doing may beambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory  it may be mystery tous but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is absurdityand that my friend was the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and inpractice   ,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
the divine masters                            most christians would agree and correctly so that           jesus christ was a divine master and a projection of god           into the physical world god incarnate                          but there are some very important related facts that           christians are completely ignorant of as are followers of           most other world religions                           first jesus christ was not unique john 316 notwith          standing  there is always at least one such divine master           god incarnate physically alive in this world at all times           a continuous succession throughout history both before and           after the life of jesus                    the followers of some of these masters founded the           worlds major religions usually perverting the teachings of           their master in the process  christians for example added           threats of eternal damnation in hell and deleted the           teaching of reincarnation                       secondly and more importantly after a particular           master physically dies and leaves this world there is           nothing that he can do for anybody except for the relatively           few people that he initiated while he was still physically           alive  that is simply the way god set things up in the           universes                                            therefore all those christians who worship jesus and           pray to jesus and expect jesus to return and save them from           their sins are only kidding themselves and have allowed           themselves to be duped by a religion that was mostly           manufactured by the romans                      and emotional feelings are a totally deceiving           indicator for religious validity                    these things are similarly true for followers of most           other major world religions including islam                     thirdly the primary function of each master is to tune           his initiates into the audible life stream or sound           current referred to as the word in john 115 and as           the river of life in revelation 221 and to personally           guide each of them thru the upper levels of heaven while they           are still connected to their living physical bodies by a           silver cord                    true salvation which completes a souls cycles of           reincarnation in the physical and psychic planes is achieved           only by reaching at least the soul plane which is five           levels or universes above the physical universe and this           cannot be done without the help of a physicallyliving divine           master                    one such divine master alive today is an american sri           harold klemp the living eck master or mahanta for the           eckankar organization now headquartered in minneapolis           po box 27300  zip 55427                    another divine master is maharaj gurinder singh ji now           living in punjab india and is associated with the sant           mat organization                      one of the classic books on this subject is the path of           the masters radha soami books po box 242 gardena ca            90247 written in 1939 by dr julian johnson a theologian           and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in india           studying under and closely observing the sant mat master of           that time maharaj sawan singh ji                    several of the eckankar books including some authored           by sri paul twitchell or sri harold klemp can be found in           most public and university libraries and some book stores or           obtained thru interlibrary loan  the book eckankarthe           key to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell is another           classic                    many christians are likely to confuse the masters with           the antichrist which is or was to be a temporary world           dictator during the socalled last days  but the masters           dont ever rule even when asked or expected to do so as           jesus was                    people who continue following christianity islam or           other orthodox religions with a physicallydead master will           continue on their cycles of reincarnation between the           psychic planes and this miserable physical world until they           finally accept initiation from a physicallyliving divine           master                             reincarnation                         the book here and hereafter by ruth montgomery           describes several kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation           as a fact of life including hypnotic regressions to past           lives about 50 accurate the subconscious mind sometimes           makes things up especially with a bad hypnotist           spontaneous recall especially by young children some of           whom can identify their most recent previous relatives           homes possessions etc dream recall of past life experi          ences deja vu familiarity with a far off land while travel          ing there for the first time on vacation the psychic read          ings of the late edgar cayce and even supporting statements           from the christian bible including matthew 171113 john the           baptist was the reincarnation of elias and john 912 how           can a person possibly sin before he is born unless he lived           before   always use the king james version  later           versions are perversions                           strong interests innate talents strong phobias etc           typically originate from a persons past lives  for example           a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually           results from having drowned at the end of a previous life            and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to           another person being met for the first time in this life           because of a bad encounter with him during a previous           incarnation                the teaching of reincarnation also includes the law of           karma galatians 67 revelation 1310 etc  people would           behave much better toward each other if they knew that their           actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the           future or in a future incarnation           2nd comings               if a divine master physically dies translates           before a particular initiate of his does then when that           initiate physically dies translates the master will meet           him on the astral level and take him directly to the soul           plane  this is the one and only correct meaning of a 2nd           coming  it is an individual experience not something that           happens for everyone all at once  people who are still           waiting for jesus 2nd coming are waiting in vain                                   planes of existence               the physical universe is the lowest of at least a dozen           major levels of existence  above the physical plane is the           astral plane the causal plane the mental plane the etheric           plane often counted as the upper part of the mental plane           the soul plane and several higher spiritual planes  the           soul plane is the first true heaven counting upward from           the physical  the planes between but not including the           physical and soul planes are called the psychic planes                    it is likely that esp telepathy astrological           influences radionic effects biological transmutations see           the 1972 book with that title and other phenomena without           an apparent physical origin result from interactions between           the psychic planes and the physical plane                    the major planes are also subdivided  for example a           subplane of the astral plane is called hades and the           christian hell occupies a small part of it created there           less than 2000 years ago by the early catholic church by some           kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a           threatening manner  the christian heaven is located           elsewhere on the astral plane  good christians will go there           for a short while and then reincarnate back to earth                                         sound current vs blind faith               the christian religion demands of its followers an           extraordinary amount of blind faith backed up by little more           than good feeling which is totally deceiving                       if a person is not hearing some form of the sound           current the word the bani the audible life stream           then his cycles of reincarnation in this miserable world will           continue                    the sound current manifests differently for different           initiates and can sound like a rushing wind ocean waves on           the sea shore buzzing bees higherpitched buzzing sound a           flute various heavenly music or other sounds  in eckankar           members start hearing it near the end of their first year as           a member  this and other experiences such as soul travel           replace blind faith

i hope i didnt award custody rich  i purposely used handle in order to avoid doing so  ie that happens to be what religions do of course there areaberrations like scientific creationism  i used best in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who so these domains aremostly ignored  i also attempted to be brief which no doubt confused thematter  as an aside for science i should have written how and when  nobodyseems to argue over whatseems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual  im nottrying to be evasive on this but from a societal perspective religion workson the other hand sometimes it is abused and misused and many suffer whichyou know  but the net result seems positive this from the anthropologicalperspective on human affairs  you might call me a neofruedian insofar as i think the masses cant get along without religion  not that generally they are incapable they just dont and for myriad reasons but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality  very seductive that immortality  therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to who and why  i suggest that this holds regardless of the truth in their answers to who and why simply because people believe  in the end spiritual beliefs are just as real as scientific facts and explanation caution to some do not take this out of context  no  in fact i dont think it is closed now at least for some individuals isnt there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a big bang singularity  this approach might presuppose an absence of who and why except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing  maybe that something doesnthave to be supernatural maybe just mechanistic  but thats a tough one forpeople today to grasp  in any case theory without empirical data is not explanation but then your question does not require data  in other words i agree that theorizing within scientific parameters is just as scientific as explaining  so the answer is who and why are not closed to scientists but i sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate  data will be necessary for improvement and that seems a long way off if ever  pretty convoluted here i hope ive made sense  i agree generally  but i prefer to put it this way  the questions of how when who and why were not open to inquiry  during the enlightenment reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when and not for the most part who and why  science was thus born out of the naturalists curiosity eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why  the ignorant the selfish the intolerant andthe arrogant of course still claim authority in all four domainsmuch obliged  funny how facts tend to muddle things isnt it  well i amsure there are plenty of scientific creationist rebuttals out there somewhere even if they have to be created from nothingjust for the record again amh  anatomically modern humans best regards ,19,misc,soc.religion.christian

as far as i can see one of the big differences between davidians andchristians is in who they follow  i have sometimes tried to put myselfin the feet of one of jesuss disciples  basically they gave up alot  career possibly family and well a whole bunch to followjesusso what is the difference  it is quite plain  jesus was good anddavid koresh was notthe problem is i think is that we try to legislate what is goodand what is bad in terms of principles  for instance there are thousands of laws in the us governing what is legal and what is not  often it is hardto bring people to justice because it is not possible to finda legal way to do it  if only we could trust judges to be justthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly and justicewould be followed  but since judges dont always get it rightwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunchesof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect the justiceof man into something perfect  but what i hear about the justicesystem in the us tells me that quite the opposite is truethere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentationmore than the material being presented  so we might consider a ranting christian to be bad but an eloquent person from anotherreligion to be good  this goes along with the american desireto protect the constitution at all costs even if it allowspeople to do bad things i think that it is the message that is important  if a man ispresenting a false message even if he is ever ever so mild manneredthen that man is performing a tremendous disservicei know that i am rambling here  i guess that what i am trying tosay is that we shouldnt be looking for principles that tell uswhy the davidians got it wrong  it is not wrong to follow andworship a person  but it is important to choose the right personit is simple  choose jesus and you got it right  chooseanyone else and you got it wrong  why  because jesus is thebegotten son of god and nobody else is  jesus was without sin andnobody else was,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

another issue of importance  was the crucification the will of god ora tragic mistake  i believe it was a tragic mistake  gods will cannever be accomplished through the disbelief of man  jesus came tothis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth  hedesperately wanted the jewish people to accept him as the messiah  ifthe crucification was the will of god how could jesus pray that thiscup pass from him  was this out of weakness  never  many men andwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causesis jesus less than these  no he is not  he knew the crucificationwas not the will of god  gods will was that the jewish people acceptjesus as the messiah and that the kingdom of heaven be established onthe earth with jesus as its head just like the jewish peopleexpected if this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine whatkind of world we would live in today  it would be a very differentworld  and that is eactly what god wanted  men and women of that agecould have been saved by following the living messiah while he was onthe earth  jesus could have established a sinless lineage that wouldhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world tolive with god  now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have towait for christs return  but when he returns will he be recognizedand will he find faith on this earth  isnt it about time for hisreturn  its been almost 2000 yearsmikeand the two simplest refutations are these1  what impact  the only record of impact comes from the new testamenti have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and thatthe recorded impact actually happened  i find it interesting that no othercontemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtainbeing torn etc  the earliest written claim we have of jesus resurrectionis from the pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than 20 yearsafter the supposed event2  it seems probable that no one displayed the body of jesus because noone knew where it was  i personally believe that the most likelyexplanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbersdont bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in onegospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might makeup in order to counter the graverobbing charge  the new testament doesrecord that jews believed the body had been stolen  if there were reallyguards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

actually jon that is quite true  christian people have causedobjective morality to look very relative  after all that was thepoint of the original question in this thread ie can we toss outchristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its ownprinciples  if you will bear with me i will attempt to explain thisapparent inconsistency from at least one christians viewpointif god exists and is the creator of mankind as the bible claims thenhe has a pretty welldefined concept of what makes people tickphysically emotionally etc  god has an objective morality for usthat is to say he has no trouble understanding what is good for ordetrimental to the creature he created 	galatians 210 for we mankind are his workmanship created in	christ jesus for good works a morality which god prepared	beforehand a welldefined design that we might walk in themhowever contrary to what many people assume including the pharaseesof the bible gods morality cannot be completely codified in a listof rules and regulations  to some extent every activity of apersons life creates a new situation to which morality must beapplied  there never could be enough volumes to codify godsobjective morality for us throughout history mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list ofrules objectivity if you please  in the old testament we haveboth principles and specific rules  by the time of jesus most of theprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rulesvolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify theapplication of the principles  we mankind werent comfortable withthe subjectivity of principles 	for reference see matthew 5 where jesus explains the difference	between the law and the principles of the law  for example in	verses 2122  you have heard that the ancients were told	you shall not commit murderand whoever commits murder shall	be liable to the court  but i say to you that everyone who is	angry with his brother shall be liable to the courtthe objective morality of god gets blurred by our ineptinterpretation of it  we christians have made our biggest errorswhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide exactlywhat god intended for us  if we christians would stay committed toseeking gods will instead of trying to prove we already had it allfigured out we might do a better job of allowing others to find godsobjective morality for themselves  if jesus is who he said hewasis and thats the fundamental question then he is objectivemorality ,19,misc,alt.atheism

i am asking you to believe in things not visible i dont know if this isbelieveing blindly or not im not sure how blindness comes into it i donot deny reason indeed i insist upon it but reason only draws conclusionsfrom evidence if you decide in advance that your reason will act only onthe evidence of the five physical senses then you cut reason off from anypossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere beyond therather provocative if inconclusive conclusion that the physical sphereis not self explanatory christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence which they call faith and which is a gift of god that is this evidenceis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself the evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists reasoningon the evidence of the senses wont help either but christians do reasonof the evidence of faith and do claim that this evidence is whollyconsistent with the evidence of the other senses and indeed that theevidence of these other senses is part of gods revelation of himselfto usit is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a god must comethrough this route there may be other senses than the physical onesproviding evidence of nonphysical realities there may of course bephysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses forall we know these senses if they exist may provide valid evidence forreason to work on and as with all senses these senses may be impairedin some people that is they may be spiritually blind in this sensebelief in god becomes an act of sight and it is disbelief which is blindfaith as i have said is not opposed to reason it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate it is clear that human beingshave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses andsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided byfaith religious believers in general and christians in particular usereason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understandingof the evidence provided by faith science claims with good reason to bethe most valid system for explaining the physical universe and christianityclaims also with good reason to be the most valid system possessed of thebest evidence for explaining gods revelations of himself to manif you doubt that christians use reason read this newsgroup for a whileand you will see rational debate aplenty,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

well ive said that when an innocent person has been executed this isobjectively a murder  however who is at blame is another questionit seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executionsrealizing the risksis to blameyes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doingany raondom activity  presumably you had not isolated yourself totallyfrom the rest of society because of thisand i argue that our law system is a similar risk  perhaps an innocentperson will be punished someday but we work to prevent this  in factmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishmentof innocentsbut such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicalson the road  again the blame is on societyyes but the state is not at fault in such a case  the state can only doso much to prevent false witnessesokay so this is what you call murder  but the question is whether or notall such murders are wrong  are you saying that all taking of human lifeis wrong no matter what the circumstancesbut this is basically how it works  society accepts the risk that aninnocent person will be murdered by execution  and every member ofsociety shares this blame  and most peoples definitions of murderinclude some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in anexecution is itmurder violates the golden rule  executions do not because by allowingit at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who theinnocent victim isreading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a convictionwas moral or not  but in an objective system only the absolute truthmatters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth  thatis twelve members must be convinced of a truthbut then if we read the minds of these people we would know that theconviction was unfairyes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew allpossible information we cant always determine the difference in ourflawed system  i think that our system is almost as good as possiblebut it still isnt objectively perfect  you see it doesnt matter ifwe know it is fair or not  objectively it is either fair or it is notbut what we know has no effect on an objective systemwhy are you so surewhy is your reality importantbut we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likelyand you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about atotally ideal and objective systemwell we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be idealwe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation tothe ideal system as possibleyes we all bear the responsibility  most people seem willing to do thiswe must realize the consequences of all our actions  why do you keepseparating the justice system from the packi dont think our country has an objective system but i think such anobjective system can exist in theory  without omniscience an objectivesystem is not possible in practice,0,atheism,alt.atheism
         god being unknowable i cant comment on his motives but it would bedistressing if he allowed us to misunderstand him through no fault of our own  for sanitys sake we must assume if we believe in him at allthat his message comes through somehow  the question is whether it comes through immediately to every individual or is contained in a complex canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are freeto interpret extend and modify the canon  if gods message is indeedmediated the further problem arises as to whether the individual understands the mediated message fully and clearly  since the responsibility for understanding lies ultimately with the individual we must assume that god in his benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source for that individual whereof the person may or may not drink    your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between moralityand politeness  you might have said burp for burping and swearing carryabout the same stigma today  if you are talking about taking the lords name in vain as a serious transgression then this example is more a case of hypocrisy than of varying moral codes if there is an absolute moral code propositions or laws in that code applyabsolutely and universally by definition  conceivably some moral codescould be subsets of the universal code as you say at the outset  so forexample gods code could include thou shalt not create beings withouta hospitable planet to live on but this law would be inapplicable to usnevertheless we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicableto us are also applicable to god but when you begin to ask what laws might appear in gods moral code you havea sense of the absurdity of the question  does god make laws for himself tofollow  perhaps god is not the sort of being to which the category moralitycan be sensibly applied,19,misc,soc.religion.christian

of the  most obstinateunbelievers quoted in various places of the wiseouran even they could not deny the occurrence of hismiracles but only called them hasha wa kellaallah forbids sorcery in order to satisfy themselves or to deceive theirfollowers  the miracles of muhammad saw have thecertainty of confirmation by consensus of ulema scholarsof islam to the hundreth degree   the miracle is the

of proofs  ofhis prophethood  and hundreds of thousands oftruthseeking men muhakkikiin with varying opinionshave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number ofways   the wise ouran alone demonstrates thousands ofthe proofs of his prophethood in addition to its own fortyaspects of miraculousness  since prophethood is as aphenomenon of humanity and hundreds of thousands ofindividuals who claimed prophethood and performedmiracles have lived and passed away then theprophethood of muhammad saw is of a certanitysuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others  forwhatever evidences qualities  and attributes  became themeans of the prophethood and messengership of all themessengers such as jesus as and moses as theyare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensivefashion by muhammad saw  and since the causes andmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in theperson of muhammad saw this authority is to be foundin him with more certanity than all the other

i do recall watt making a comment to this effect though it was quite a fewyears back and i cant cite the specifics  i also recall that cecil andrus whowas secretary of the interior during the carter administration respondedto watts comments by pointing out the stewardship role that god gaveto man as recorded in genesis  which makes me wonder who are thetrue conservatives  it seems to me that a conservative should want toconserve things of value for longterm societal benefit  this form ofconservation should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live as well as the moral environment in which they relateto one another and to godimho watts stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served on the board of directors for jim bakkers organization during a time in which bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed bakker in federal prison,15,christian,alt.atheism

     the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all      one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate   at least to this laymans mind there must be a causal event  no  reasonable alternative exists  i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime  causes precede their effects and i must concede here  cause before effect implies time time is partof spacetime  hense the argument would be valid  i could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being uniqueto this spacetime but i wont 8 because the point is moot  doesntaddress why which petri pikho addresses below  i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonablealternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and onethat could  be invalidated given time and further discovery by thescientist  i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarilyspecify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description ofthe phenomena in question  am i mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime  emerge from  nothing science has some good candidates for an answerall of which require something we christians readily admit to faiththe fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive  with out conclusive evidence we are left with faithit could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven asbest as a nonrepeatable event can be proven  but i ask what holds  someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith a couple of paragraphs deleted  summary we ask why does theuniverse exist  i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely  1 why is there existence why anything exists  and  2 how did the universe emerge from nothing  it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it isnt consider the followingapparently it is for many persons  hence we have religions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in nonexistence  actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that dont exist dont exist tautology at its bestcarefully examine the original question and then the counterquestion the first asks why while the second is a request for definition  it doesnt address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence  the second question is unanswerable indeed forhow do we identify something as nothing arent they mutually exclusiveterms  how do we identify a state of nonexistence again this isnearing the limits of this simple laymans ability to comprehend and iwould appreciate an explanation i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things thatdontdont is as grounded in the realm of the nonfalsifiableas does the theists belief in god  it is based on the assumptionthat there is not a reason for being something as ultimatelyunsupportable as the position of there being a reason  its veryfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is areasonwe come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reasonif the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you aresatisfied and need not a doctor  if the latter your search is justbeginning   i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this questiontime will tell 8  some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianityagreed  it would lead me to question their definition of christianity aswell another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existencethis does not preclude his existence  it only seeks to identify hisqualities implying he exists to have qualities btw the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methodslike the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive  note i am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe inwhich we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective  iseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of thecreatori also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why   itappears that m pihko agrees as we shall see  but because a tool isinadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question  assertingthat why is an invalid question does not provide an answer    as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  that isnt  true of something outside of nature ie supernatural  this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i cannot see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we existmy apologies  i was using why as why did this come to be  why didpreexistence become existence  why did prespacetime become spacetimebut we come to the admission that science fails to answer why  becauseit cant be answered in the realm of modern science does that make thequestion invalid  i dont believe any  technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite  having all of the parts available just my opinion  this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a labi suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus was vindicated  before someone starts jumping up and down screaminginquisition note i said vindicated  i certainly hope weve gottenbeyond the shooting the messenger stagem pihko does present a good point though  we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on  will it be shaken by theproduction of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek tounderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said andcontinues to say in his wordwhy do i ask why apologies to budweiser and

yourselfin fact i may post some of it here if it isnt too longi havent read lewiss article so i cant comment directly upon it andhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that hispolitical motives make him a biased writer on islam  his antiislamicpolemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often basedon telling halftruthsagain read orientalism by edward said  i am _not_ asking you to takewhat i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to getthis book it is a wellknown book and check the evidence out for_yourself_if slavery is _in reality_ as opposed to in the practice of somemuslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexualpurposes is necessarily opposed tooi understand your point of view selim  i think rather it is _us_who are not getting through to _you_some of the points you repeat above i have already answered beforeregarding women i have made posting after posting on this subjectshowing that islam is not antiwoman etc  however have you beencompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them  i just reposted avery good one under the title islam and women reposted fromsocreligionislam  if this has already disappeared from your sitethen please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of thisexcellent article  imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficientregarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery  the second one i madewhich is a repost of an article i wrote early last year  is basedcompletely on the quran and contains numerous quranic verses andhadiths to support its point of viewour approaches are different  you are arguing from a historicalstandpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the quranand hadiths  now just because people say they are muslims and performa particular action does that automatically mean that their action ispart of islam even if it is opposed by the quran and sunnah  no  ofcourse notlet me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this foryou  the quran prohibits drinking  now if a person says i am amuslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now meanthat islam teaches that people should drink beer  of course not andonly an idiot would think sodo you see my pointyou are judging islam here on capitalist terms  capitalism is anideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximisetheir wealth  this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachingsto say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to becapitalist  this does not mean that islam does not support afreemarket  for it does in general  but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand itone can postulate numerous reasons for this  your theory is that it isbecause islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etcselim i will give you a clear historical example to show you thefallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do thatislam  lack of education and powerfor a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful  for asignificant section of history the islamic world was the foremost inthe sciences  so to say that islam is for example antieducation iscompletely absurd  you try to blame this situation on islam  historyshows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must beother reasons for this situationwell selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extentof your knowledge of islam  i really think you are notknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims arefollowing the quran or notthe islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at onestage  yet somehow in your theory it is by following the quranthat muslims are backwards in education  selim it is _your_ thesisthat is antihistorical for you conveniently overlook this historicalfact which contradicts your theory you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated itso far it seems to me that your view on islam being antieducation isquite contrary to history  that you are so convinced of your viewsmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all ofthisi think selim you should consider taking your own advicehere tooselim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrateignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularlywith respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so ithink  yet you say that your viewpoint is based on historyselim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts thatyou are an apostate from islam  i think you should slow down and startthinking clearly about the issues and start _reading_ some of ourpostings about

stop hold it you have a few problems here official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi party long before the nazis ever came to power so this objection is a redherring even if established history is wrong on this point moreover none of the histories ive read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging roehm a point i saw reiterated was thathitler and the party covered up these accusations if you are going to accuseofficial history of being a fabrication you should at least get your factsright the pretext for purging roehm was that he was planning to use the sa ina coup against hitler nowhere is there mention of using allegations ofhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards itis possible that the histories ive read have not mentioned this but i doubtit  would it be in hitlers best interest to admit to the world that hisformer right hand man was a homosexual anyway as i said before it is always possible that i have missed references to the nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the sa after the night of the long knives  but this does not prove that they were false even the nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage in any case this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the sa during the 1920sah yes i forgot this was being posted to altconspiracy i can smell theparanoia from here since the nazis never officially charged roehm with homosexuality at least not according to what ive read id like to know what tainted evidence you are talking about since the accusations were made by persons outside of the nazi party long before it came to power and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in germany in the 1920s and 30s just how would it be possible for the nazis to go back in time and plant tainted evidence how exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world without the discrepancies being obvious what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matterdo you know about and what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters some of whom were not nazis and what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist the revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nutsthis is just about the only thing we agree on i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people  roehm and his sa buddies  who were homosexuals must disturb some people the feelingseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that thismust be an attempt to bash homosexuals this fear  often justified  is whatlies behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me but thisis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject if you really think that historians are so incompetent why dont you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject if you cant tell from their footnotes im a graduate student in history writing to professors andtracking down sources is old hat but my time is limited and this is not myspecialty  and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that wouldcast one shred of doubt on existing evidence im not going to waste my timetrying to debunk someones paranoia do the research yourselfgiven that you already consider all evidence tainted what on earth wouldconstitute concrete particulars and since when have concrete particulars beenconsidered shrewd guessesi suggest that those who do not trust popular historians irving et al historians writing for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious footnotes  should try instead reading academic historians who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail this is the place to start looking assuming that one really wants to know the truthill bet the folks on altpagan are tired of this subject already myapologies  we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent i forget which godsare responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subjectboundaries,19,misc,soc.religion.christian

the only unity ive found which is true is when all parties involved aredisciples  i came out of a church in which even the differentcongregations were always competing and arguing about which one wasbetter and who had the better messages while none of them put anythinginto practice from those messages  since becoming a disciple ivefound that when i travel to another church in the same movement theyare just as accepting there as any other  we had a retreat back injanuary when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up thisretreat was for college students and it was as though i had known eventhe people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciplethe previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky  oneof the keys to unity is unselfish love and selfsacrifice  that is onlyone area in which disciples stand out from christians  also anotherpart of unity is a common depth of conviction  ive also been a part ofsome christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity betweenchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved  a lack ofconviction about everything they believed  that was why they could beunified they didnt care about the truth but delighted in getting alongtogethercreeds  what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmlybetteraccording to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are goingto be there  as per a previous note i mentioned that there are thosewho teach falsely by many means  there are also differences of opinionand belief  however scripture states     in the following directives i have no praise for you for yourmeetings do more harm than good  in the first place i hear that whenyou come together as a church there re divisions among you and to someextent i believe it  no doubt there have to be differences among you toshow which of you have gods approval 1 corinthians 111719how will god show his approval  by fruitfulness see acts 247 butbefore that there are these qualities   devotion to the apostles teaching   fellowship   communion   filling with awe for god   all having everything in common   glad and sincere hearts   praising god   enjoying the favor of the peopleall these are mentioned in acts 24247  god also shows that those whohave these qualities are persecuted  look at stephen a man full offaith and of the holy spirit acts 65 who was later stoned acts75460  one can say that a church is the true church only if that church isperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement  ihave yet to find that but the closest one ive found is the bostonchurch of christ movement which constantly strives to have errorspointed out and corrected  it is also the only one ive seen which istotally sold out to godas for cooperation that can always occur  unity on the other hand maynever occur  as for those who think about only one church being thetrue one i remind them that mark 93841 states that there aredisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but theywill not lose their reward  as with the boston movement ive heardnumerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out therethat are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make themany less disciples  of course few people admit that theyve ever runinto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movementi know i haventi must warn that this sounds cliquey to me  a clique is a group whichruns around together to some extent exclusively  this causes problemsin fellowship and causes divisions  i would not say at all that this issomething correct for a churchgroup to do for any reason  in one ofthe churches i attended for example there was an internal clique ofpeople who were on the 14 different groupscommitteesorganizationalheads of the congregation  they rarely talked to anyone else outside ofthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without anotheroffice being opened up so that they would have to step right back intheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came henearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish hewouldve since they still have no clue about what it means to be adisciple  anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to bebroken down but is still there  so i must warn against such divisionwithin  theres enough division without,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

still arm themselves to defend thefaith and stockpile food as well  they have been involved in quite alot of illegal activity  including multiple and often underage wivesfor the leaders  a practice still in vogue with some splinters of theirsect  the parallels between koresh and joseph smith are striking                                         by they you mean the leaders of the lds church  i grant you that whenjoseph smith was still alive plenty of accusations were filed most ofwhich had little bearing with reality as evidenced by various verdictsi have studied lds history for 15 years now and i have yet to see provethat the lds leadership was involved in quote illegal activitiesplural marriage yes but your charge of underage wives sounds like itcould have originated from a tabloid and discredits the high moralstandards which characterized these leaders and families unlike as itappears those of david koresh        joseph smith started the sect  after he and his brother hyramwere murdered in a nauvoo il jail cell church membership split overwho to follow  initially smith was considered a prophet just likemohammed a rather interesting parallel considering muslims considerchrist to be a prophet the same as jews im led to understand  makeno mistake this was no messiah were talking about in smith  theand neither did he claim he was  as the church reflects the moralaptitude of its leaders and especially those of joseph smith i havenothing but the highest respect for this inspired man whose only crimewas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision  many have triedto explain the smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 85million member strong church stands as a witness that joseph smithstestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the messagethought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handeddown father to son  after joseph smith died his son was onlyentering his teens  brigham young and a few others claimed to havebeen bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death  thecouncil of twelve the church governing body wasnt of much helphere and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sectsbrigham young took his followers to salt lake  the rest waitedfor smith jr to grow up enough to assume leadership  the otherclaimants to the leadership were soon ignored like mike dukakis the rest were apostates and excommunicated members of the churchwhile the great majority of the membership the twelve and the variousauxiliary organizations chose to accept brigham young as the newprophet and leader of the church  if you knew your lds scriptures anddoctrine you would have known that brigham young was the first inline to fill the prophet joseph smiths vacancy he was the seniorapostle in the quorum and various comments made by joseph indicatedthat it was brigham who would lead the latterday exodus to the westother rightful heirs were either dead hyrum smith or excommunicatedoliver cowdery and while persecutions abounded and intensifiedjoseph smith had already given orders to look for a new place an emptyland beyond the boundaries of the united states at that time  thisrekhabite principle pseudographia was well understood and antipatedby the great majority of lds faithful and was not questioned by themgranted a couple of doityourselfers stayed behind unwilling tosacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown butthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat  thechurch benefitted from this purification process they became evenmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world        both sects practiced the 1year food stockpile doctrineand this being frontier and farming country most carried or atleast owned weapons  there is little evidence that they were amilitaristic sect given that they tended to move on rather thanface largescale opposition  brigham young having suffered agreat deal getting to salt lake seems to have been quitejustified in making military training a good thing  rememberthis was far beyond where even the us army went and these peoplehad nobody to turn to save themselves        just a little context to put this all in perspectivebtw since when is the church of jesus christ of latterday saints one ofthe largest denominations in the country a sect  it didnt splinterfrom any other religion as did say the southern baptists or methodistsso what did the mormons get  it seems that j edgar hoover was veryimpressed with the way they kept secrets  theyre pledged to defendsecrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood  many actuallydo  even to the point of suicidewhat a balloney  suicide is sinful and against the law of god  i amnot comfortable with this alleged cosiness with mammon i assure youthat many among us reject this attitude categorically  period  ouronly true allegiance is to our god and to the leaders which he hasappointed to represent him  in any regard to read this trash aboutsuicide and atone for sins with blood is yet another insultingmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for        the rlds the reorganized lds are friendly rivals of the ldsand delight in telling stories about them which generates quick retortsfrom the lds members and everybody has a grand time  at no time havei ever even heard this hinted at  im taking it with a salt blockmake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top  so he hired virtually no one butmormons until the fbi was almost exclusively staffed by members of thechurch of later day saints  though j edgar is finally gone the fbipersonnel especially the field agents are still heavily mormoni have often wondered how this might affect the fbis treatmentof religious organizations a mormon would consider hereticalpreposterous  even if this were true reliable data please iam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codesof honor and conduct thats why they were selected for in thefirst place remember  besides one of our articles of faithstrongly states the principle of freedom of religion and that allpeople are free to worship how where or what they may        if its true there would be little affect  lds and rldsphilosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the truechurch as set down by jesus but that god will judge each on hisown merits  in addition the rlds also contend and the lds mayas well that ignorance of the true way tm is an excuse  youcan only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejectedit  in short lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans tobuddhists secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong theywill not be penalized for ignorance  it is more likely that hooverliked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbadealcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the likethese people are the salt of the earth and as such are moreeasily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used

the answer to both questions is yesall scripture is true being inspired by god  the evidence for thisclaim has been discussed ad nauseum in this groupsimilarly all truth is absolute  indeed a nonabsolute truth is a contradiction in terms  when is something absolute  when it is alwaystrue  obviously if a truth is not always true then we have acontradiction in terms  many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world  such astatement is terribly selfcontradictory  let me put it to you thisway  if there are no absolutes shouldnt we conclude that the statementthere are no absolutes is not absolutely true  obviously we have acontradiction herethis is just one of the reasons why christians defy the world by claimingthat there are indeed absolutes in the universeso  people sometimes disagree about what is true  this does not negatethe fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe  moreoverevangelical christianity at least still professes to believe in certaintruths  man is sinful man needs salvation and jesus is the propitiationfor mankinds sins to name a few  any group that does not profess tobelieve these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

 i will clarify my earlier quote  gods laws were originally written for  the israelites  jesus changed that fact by now making the law applicable to all people not just the jews  gentiles could be part of the kingdom of heaven through the saving grace of god  i never said that the law was made obsolete by jesusjust for reference heres the earlier quotemalcolm lee mleepostroyalroadsca wrote in reference to leviticus 219and deuteronomy 222025 these laws written for the israelites gods chosen people whom god had expressly set apart from the rest of the world  the israelites were a direct witness to gods existence  to disobey god after knowing that god is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to gods chosen people  but jesus has changed all of that  we are living in the age of grace  sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  there is repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ  and not just for a few chosen people  salvation is available to everyone jew and gentile alikethese are two conflicting statements  to say one is a clarification of theother is a breach of logic  i dont mind people shifting their position onan issue  it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no changewas made  what about deuteronomy 222025  is it wrong now  did jesuschange that if anything he clarified the law such as in that quote you made  in the following verses jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon the law giving clearer meaning to what god intendedsure he does this  however he doesnt address the notion of stoningnonvirgin brides because this needs no clarification  are you going todeny that deuteronomy 222025 is not patently clear in its intent i think you will agree with me that there are in todays world a lot of modernday pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heartill agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the biblefrom end to end and dont believe in it  depending on how they use thisknowledge they can be scary  they can argue any position they desire andback it up with selected parts of the bible  such pharisees include davidkoresh and adolph hitler  i will qualify this by saying i dont know ifthey actually believed what they were preaching but the ends certainlymade the means look frighteninghowever just as scary are those that dont know much of the bible butbelieve every word  in fact this is probably scarier since there are farmore of these people from what ive seen  in addition they are very easyto manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees since they dont know enoughto debate with these people christianity is not just a set of rules its a lifestyle that changes ones perspectives and personal conduct  and it demands obedience to gods willno it demands obedience to a book  if god came down and personally toldme how i should behave then i would say that i would be doing gods willby doing it  however if preachers pastors and evangelists tell me toobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close totwo millenia even longer for the ot even if i follow everything in itwith my heart i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying im doingthe will of god some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  that is their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it toowell if god respects it so much how come there is talk in the bible abouteternal damnation for nonbelievers  i see little respect eminating fromthe god of the bible  i see a selfish and spiteful god god be with younot yours thanks  malcolm lee  rob lanphierlanphi872snakecsuidahoedulanph872uidahoeduand for the curious here is my earlier post,19,misc,soc.religion.christian

 i hope i gave you a fairly solid answer to this one i simply dont agree with the embodied version of a satan who is a separate creation or a force and there are quite physical descriptions of heaven and hell in the holy quran the bible etc  there have been times in the spiritual and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical descriptions of heaven hell and satan were taken quite literally and that worked for the time  as i mentioned in the tradition cited above for example it was sufficient in the absence of a theory about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic     which begs the question if satan in this case is     metaphorical how can you be certain allah is not     the same way the bottom line here however is that describing a spiritual plane in human language is something like describing color to a person who has been blind from birth  you may want to read the book flatland if you havent already or the dragons egg  the first is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con ceptsome deleted for space saving when language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers then such conventions as metaphor allegory and the like come to be necessary  the unseen is described in terms which have reference and meaning for the readerlistener  but like all models a compro mise must be made when speaking metaphorically clarity and directness of meaning equivalence of perception and the like are all crippled  but what else can you do     this is why i asked the above  how would you then     know god exists as a spirit or being rather than     just being metaphorical  i mean its okay to say     well satan is just metaphorical but then you     have to justify this belief and justify that god is     not some metaphor for something else     i say this because there are many many instances of     satan described as a being such as the tormentor in      the old testament book of job or the temptor in the     new testament gospels  in the same way god too is     described as a being or spirit  how am i to know     one is metaphorical and not the other     further belief in god isnt a bar to evil  lets     consider the case of satanists even if satan were     metaphorical the satanist would have to believe     in god to justify this belief  again we have a      case where someone does believe in god but by     religious standards they are evil  if bobby     does see this let him address this question alsodeleted some more on metaphorstephen    ____  ____   _       _     atheist   _        _    _   _ _ _ _      libertarian  ____  ____   _   _  _       proindividuality       _  _     _  _       _        proresponsibility____  _      _ _       _ jr     and all that jazz,0,atheism,soc.religion.christian

yes and everyone thinks as you do  no one thinks that he is going to causeor be involved in a fatal accident but the likelihood is surprisingly highjust because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shootingblanks does not mean that you are less guiltyyou mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation  and you shouldnote that that situation will never occur  there are always other optionsthank killing  why dont you just say that all killing is wrong  thisis basically what you are sayingare you attempting to be condescendingbut most people have found the risk to be acceptable  you are probablymuch more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electricblender than you are to be executed as an innocent  i personally thinkthat the risk is acceptable but in an ideal moral system no such riskis acceptable  acceptable is the fudge factor necessary in such anapproximation to the ideal,0,atheism,alt.atheism

johnthe problem here is that you have taken one peice of my response withoutbothering to connect it with the other parts  i have repeatedly noted thatone needs to take the problematic historcity of acts and then examine thework of john dominic crossan and burton mack  once you have taken the timeto examine recent developments in biblical scholarship i think you will grasp more clearly what i am sayingcertainly this is an issue as i think the situation in waco shows most clearly  if all that is required is that people are willing to die for abelief for it to be true then surely david koresh is the son of god  nothe spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to bewilling to die must be put to rest  the other problem is that it is so monologocentric  even if the resurrection was a big deal which it doesntseem to have been for either q thomas or even john to a certain degreethere are a lot of other things which the early christians could have beendoing together that would have been worth dying for  it is my belief thateven the idea of a mixed race community which brought down regionalnationalboundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to bewilling to die  radical communties do that eg jonestown waco warsaw etcbut my original point was that roman persecution which is the only persecutionwe have documented proof of was not about whether a carpenter came back fromthe dead  such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the romanor greek mind  my point is that avoidance of military and civic duty ieemperor worship would have been much more problematic  which has nothingto do with the resurrection at all  when nero used christians as human torches to light up his dinner party it wasnt because the believe in a risen savior it was because they were supposedly involved in incest andcannablism  the argument that christians were martyred for the resurrectionjust cannot stand up to critical examination,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

seannabnrca seanna sm watson asks  what is the objection to celebration of easter        the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it easter or eashtar or ishtar or ishtarti or other spellings is the paganwhore goddess of fertility  therefore your question to me is what isthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess  when phrasedthat way i suspect or at least i would hope that it becomes immeadiatelyapparent what my objection to celebrating her would be   it is celebration of the resurrection of jesus       no you are thinking perhaps of ressurection sunday i think though im not too crazy about the word sunday but i certainly likethis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess     for that matter stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast offirst fruits  torah commands that this be observed on the day followingthe sabbath of passover week  sunday by any other name in modernparlance  why is there so much objection to observing the resurrectionon the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured  why jump it allover the calendar the way easter does  why not just go with the sundayfollowing passover the way the bible has it  why seek after unbiblicalmethods   i dont recall a command in scripture for us to celebrate  the resurrection but it is the sole and only reason that  we are christianshow could we not celebrate it       so what does this question have to do with easter the whoregoddess  i am all for celebrating the resurrection  just keep thatwhore out of the discussion   if it is only the name which is a problem i suggest that if  we are too concerned about etymology there are a lot of  words we are going to have to drop  as an aside some  terminally pc people here in ottawa want dictionaries to be  altered so that there are no negative definitions associated  with the word _black_ so as not to offend people of colour        yes i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repavestreets with afrocanadiantop   i still think blacktop soundsbetter though   as a short person i hope they will also remove the definition  curt or surly associated with my physical description        fine by me  and while we are at it the lefthanded people areboth sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objections fromthat quarter as well   in quebec french the word for the celebration of the  resurrection is paquesthis is etymologically related  to pesach passover and the pascal lamb  so is the  french canadian mostly roman catholic celebration better  because it uses the right name       yes that sounds much better to me  is there anyone out there wouldthinks that phrasing sounds worse   so from this i infer that there are different rules for  christians of jewish descent  what happened to there is  neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for  all are one in christ jesus       read the letter to philemon  now tell me was philemons slavereturned to him  were there different rules upon the slave than uponphilemon  how about male and female  are there different rules thatapply to them as well  or if there is no more male and female can adamand steve get married to each other in your congregation  yes there aredifferences in form and function  but the way we come to salvation inmessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life i am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion as itseems repetitive but this particular point is one that i believe isnew  the objection is not to having a holiday but to its nameid like to suggest that people think very carefully about thisargument  words often change their meaning over time  the days ofthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods  somechristians prefer to refer to first day second day etc  howeverthe majority of christians have not been persuaded  the questionseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary showsas the derivation of a word if what people mean by it and think whenthey use it is differentindeed id like to suggest that postings like this could themselves bedangerous  suppose people in general use easter to mean thecelebration of christs resurrection  postings trying to convincethem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess runthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to opposethey are doing their best to create a linkage in peoples mindsbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess  its not clear thatthis is a healthy thing,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
the problem you see here is that some christians claim things aboutthe bible which they dont actually believe or practice ive knownall sorts of christians ranging from the trendiest of liberals tothe firebreathing fundamentalists and although many on the conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible isa perhaps the source of absolute truth i dont know of anyonewho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living traditionwhile i am not a roman catholic i believe this is close to the officialposition of the rc church perhaps an rc would like to commentthe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained interms of the social context of the time you would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophatandcane and give you some big songanddance routine about why this other passages as well arent directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the bible and what they actually practice are two different things but mostly it doenstwhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of christiansi would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy in thiscase making claims about the bible which the claimants dont actuallyput into practice but if we step back from the namecalling andlook at what people are attempting to say we see that they are tryingto express very concisely the unique place the bible holds within thechristian faith so when people use such words or phrases as word ofgod inerrant infallibale the manufacturers handbook theonly rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe thebible we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look atthe mere words they use some of the above descriptions are demostratablyfalse and others are selfcontradictory but in my experience people aregenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker evenwhen the speakers words are at variance with their intentions a biblicalexample is from the garden of eden where god asks where are you and adamexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself if adam hadanswered gods words he would have said something like im here in thistree the problem seems to arise when christians insist that thesewords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif most peoplehave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding ofthe place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrasesand explanations that others usei hope this helps                                                                     ___bill rea                                                            o owuw,15,christian,soc.religion.christian
i think that you are changing the meaning of values here perhapsit is time to backtrack and take a look at the wordvalue n 1 a fair equivalent or return for something such as goodsor service 2 monetary or material worth 3 worth as measured in usefulness or importance merit 4 a principle standard or qualityconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable 5 precise meaning asof a word 6 an assigned or calculated numerical quantity 7 mus the relative duratation of a tone or rest 8 the relative darkness orlightness of a color 9 the distinctive quality of a speech or speechsound in context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best in termsof scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply note thatthese definitions do not mean the same thingin my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of areach science has its basis in observable fact even the usages of theword value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standardof measurement i would conclude that science does not have itsbasis in values and so your statement above fails in fact if oneconcludes that a scientific set of measurements values are based onsystems derived from observation then it must follow that in ascientific context there is no such thing as there is no such thing asobjective valuesback to the present this has nothing to do with a moral system anyhowjust because the word values is used in both contexts does not meanthat there is a relationship between the two contextsif one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one mustfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective consideringthe meaning of the word objective i doubt that this will ever happenso back to the original questionand objective morality isif you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that willbe a good beginning,19,misc,alt.atheism

   the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all    one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  at least to this laymans mind there must be a causal event  no reasonable alternative existsi would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects but if you claim that there must bean answer to how did the universe our spacetime  emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answeri have always wondered why christians use the there are questionsscience or atheism cannot answer argument i hope this is theappropriate group to ask this questionthe most popular question is the question of origins why does theuniverse exist or anything for that matteri think this question should actually be split into two parts namely1 why is there existence why anything existsand2 how did the universe emerge from nothingit is clear science has nothing to say about the first question howeveris it a meaningful question after alli would say it isnt consider the followinga diehard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubtones very existence since it is so easy to doubt everything else i cannot be _sure_ the world exists it may be my mind fooling me can i ever be sure i existhowever it is only possible to exist or not to exist someoneinsert an appropriate shakespeare quote here  a being that does not exist cannot doubt ones existencea being that does exist can doubt ones existence but this would bepointless  the being would exist anywaylet us return to the original question why a being that does notexist does not need any reasons for its nonexistence this beingis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind but letus assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivitypostulate the question why anything exists can be countered bydemanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingnessor in nonexistence actually both questions turn out to bedevoid of meaning things that exist do and things that dont existdont exist tautology at its besti seriously doubt god could have an answer to this questionsome christians i have talked to have said that actually god ishimself the existence however i see several problems with thisanswer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god isactually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us andthem this is pantheism not christianityanother answer is that god is the _source_ of all existencethis sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does godhimself exist then if god is the source of his own existenceit can only mean that he has in terms of human time alwaysexisted but this is not the same as the source of all existencethis argument sounds like god does not exist but metaexistsand from his metaexistent perspective he created existencei think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of wordsthe best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapableof understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do notaccept such answers since i do not have any other methodsthe second question how did the universe emerge from nothingbelongs to the domain of science and i for one do not doubt thequestion can be answered by its methods many cosmologists havesuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emergefrom vacuum this possibility has been suggested in a recenthawking biography see also lizhi  shuxian creation of the universeworld scientific 1989 however i think the sci groups are moreappropriate for discussions like this  as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  that isnt true of something outside of nature ie supernaturalthis is not true science is a collection of models telling us hownot why something happens i cannot see any good reason why the whyquestions would be bound only to natural things assuming that thesupernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it isas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist  i believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining  reproducing life ever  ive never been much of a prophet though i cant even picture new york in my mind 8   i dont believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinionthis opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems aresomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems do christiansin general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announcethey have created primitive life say small bacteria in a labthere is a problem with your prophecy artificial life has been createdalthough not yet in a chemical form computer simulations of evolutioncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium althoughtheir code is electronic as well as their metabolism see a recent booksteven levy artificial life  the quest for a new creation jonathancape london 1992artificial chemical life is just around the corner  after all no spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do notviolate any physical laws as we know them  you dont mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you  after all if we of christ are deluding ourselves you really have nothing to worry about ehexactly this is why i think atheists should _not_ post any evangelicalatheist arguments to socreligion groups since people who seek to find peace in religions must be

this frayed thread has turned into a patented altatheism 5on1pingpong game and i dont have any strong disagreement so ill tryto stick to the one thing i dont quite follow about the argumentit seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the biblewas enlightened for its times ie closer to what we would considermorally good based on our standards and past experience on the onehand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on theother hand disclaimer  im speaking from the jewish perspective where the bible means what many call the old testament and where the interpretation is not necessarily the raw text but instead the court cases commentaries and traditions passed down through jewish communities  this seems the crux to me if you judge the bible according to a long line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary valuesbut if thats how the bible is actually being used todayshouldnt that be how we should judge it  if most peopleuse scissors to cut paper shouldnt consumers reportstest scissors for papercutting ability even thoughscissors may have been designed originally to cut cloththats possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teachingjewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that thishighlyinterpreted version is what was enlightened for its timesto attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that theoriginal scissormakers were unusually advanced at papercutting fortheir times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never evenheard of paperim not arguing that the bible is disgusting though some of thehistory depicted in it is by modern standards  however history isfull of similar abuses and i dont think the biblical accounts areworse than their contemporariesor possibly ours  on the other handi dont know of any reason to think the history described in the bibleshows less abuse than their contemporaries or ours  that complexand benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythicinterpretations of that history is interesting but i still dontthink it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use itto attack condemnation of the original history,0,atheism,soc.religion.christian

the empty tomb  can we trust it                   by the late wilbur m smith dd                              18941977          when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about     himself and frequently repeated it  let me quote it for you                 behold we go up to jerusalem and the son               of man shall be betrayed unto the chief               priests and unto the scribes and they shall               condemn him to death and shall deliver him               to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and               to crucify him and the third day he shall               rise again matthew 201819          wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus     who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving     reproval knew he would die before he was 40 years of age  he     knew the very city where he would die  he knew that the religious     leaders of his own race would condemn him to death  he knew that     one of his own would betray him  he knew that before his actual     death took place he would be mocked and scourged  he knew exactly     how he would dieby crucifixion          all this is in itself remarkable  but more amazing than the     minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted     would follow shortly after he was buriedthat he would rise     again  he even designated the timeon the third day          but since it is on this central factthe death and resurrec     tion of jesus christthat the whole truth or untruth of chris     tianity turns let us examine it more closely          the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and     ointments was distributed  the body was placed in a tomb which     had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against     the entrance  the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had     predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and     on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the     disciples from carrying away the body  early sunday morning some     of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the     tomb to further anoint the body  to their utter astonishment     they found the stone rolled away the body gone  they rushed back     to tell the disciples  shortly two of jesus friends peter and     john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the     tomb empty just as the women had said  even the guards came     hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them     to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew 2811          how did this tomb become empty          one of the most famous new testament scholars in america     professor of new testament literature in a large theological     seminarywrote to the author in answer to my question of how     the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by     bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb     became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the     chimney at christmas time          but he didnt realize that santa clause never did come down     any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa     claus  and there is a jesus  he died he was buried in the     tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone          those are facts of history  no one can escape the responsi     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old          another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar     in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt     that the women went to the wrong tomb          the facts are these          first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to     which by mistake they could have gone          second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or     more people to forget the place where they have buried their     dearest loved one within less than three days  even if the women     did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to     the wrong tomb          third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb          there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the     evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself                  now when they were going behold some               of the watch came into the city and showed               unto the chief priests all the things that               were done  and when they were assembled               with the leaders and had taken counsel they               gave large money unto the soldiers saying               say ye his disciples came by night and stole               him away while we slept  and if this come to               the governors ears we will persuade him and               secure you  so they took the money and did               as they were taught  and this saying is com               monly reported among the jews until this day               matthew 281115          this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the     fact that the tomb was empty          you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never     questioned but that the tomb was empty  they never even went out to     see if what the guards had reported was truethey knew it was true          another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that     the tomb was emptythe soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples     came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep          how could they know what was going on while they were asleep     obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court          even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject     the explanation the very character and the later history of the     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away     the body of jesus          first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in     jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his     resurrectionbecause all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty  if there     had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected     then proved          second surely one of the disciples even most of them would     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent     it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lieand most     of these men did          the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded storiesit     would have lost it power  instead this truth swept the world closed     pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing     humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever          but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to     what had happened to him          instead he appeared to themliterally visibly frequently          he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning     matthew 28110 later that day to mary magdalene alone john 2011     18 and to simon peter also alone luke 2434  in the afternoon he     walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke 241335 and that     night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper     room at jerusalem mark 161416 luke 243640 etc          a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at     the same place john 202628  once he was seen by above 500 brethren     on a mountain in galilee i corinthians 156 and finally to the     apostles just before his ascension mark 1619 luke 245052 acts 13     8          as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor     ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed     attempting to deny their literalness  but these theories are     unreasonable without supporting evidence  none has ever won the     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the     appearances          moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are     antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle     increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale     nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of     amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president     of princetonthese men and countless others have believed it          but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it  what has     it to do with my life  what has it to do with your life  just this     it seals with certitude the teachings of christ          jesus taught many great truthsespecially many about himself  he     claimed to have come down from god          he said he was the way to god          he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly          he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one     else had it          he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to     us          thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed     that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth          do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe     that his words are all true          the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us     that he is none other than the one he claimed to bethe son of god          and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead     testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some     day raise us also up from the grave as he promised          in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all     this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life  for     he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan     ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

i have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again khomeini put a price on the head of someone in another country this makes him a jerkas well as an international outlaw khomeini advocates the view thatthere was a series of twelve islamic leaders the twelve imams whoare free of error or sin this makes him a heretic in the quran muhammad is chastised for error directly by god the quran says thatmuhammad is the greatest example of proper islamic behavior thusno muslim is free from error perhaps it seems so to you but this is hardly the case there iswidespread agreement about matters of islam there certainly aremany viewpoints on issues which are not particularly islamic inand of themselves but this is so for any large group of peopleunder the same name the quran is not particularly imprecise in wording though it is truethat several interpretations are possible in the interpretations ofmany words however as an entire text the quran makes its meaningsprecise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to cometo agreement about them ,0,atheism,alt.atheism

seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion andreality on your own you wouldnt need to rely on doctrines thatneed to be updated  my experience of christianity 25 years isthat most christians seek answers from clergymen who have littleor no direct experience of spiritual matters and that most ofthese questions can be answered by simple introspection  mostpeople suspect that they cannot trust their senses but few takethe next step to figure out that they can trust themselves  not toget too esoteric but it seems that most religions christianityincluded are founded by particularly intuitive people who understandthisstuff deletedand what if the original poster pixie is never converteddoes it make sense that she or i or the majority of humanityfor that matter would go to hell for eternity as many christians believe  it makes more sense to me that ratherthan be converted to a centuriesold doctrine that holds nolife for her that she simply continue to decide for herselfwhat is best  ,15,christian,soc.religion.christian

true  at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmosthe military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions fromthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets  but later and especiallyafter the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone  itseemed to me that they didnt have the stomach for the reality of warthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare  its likethey were only progulfwar as long as it was nice and clean smartmissiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of deaddying and maimed civilians started cropping up  what naive hypocrites discussion about blanketbombing and abombs deleted                            i should have said here militarily justified  it seems from yourcomments below that you understood this as meaning morally justifiedi apologizei have often wondered about this  ive always thought that the first bombshould have been dropped on japans island fortress of truk  a goodinpenatrable military target  the second bomb couldve been held backfor use on an industrial center if need be  but i digressyes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japanwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb  unfortunatelythe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the ussulimatum  therefore the second bomb was dropped  most unfortunate imoi dont regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be madewhich affect the lives of innocent people  but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret thesuffering caused by those decisions  actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted usand allied action  if some backwater country took over some otherbackwater country we probably wouldnt intervene  not that we dontcare but we cant be the worlds policman  or if a coup had occuredin kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldnt have actedbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived tosaudi arabia  but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasionby a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the wests oil interests caused us to take actionim not setting up a strawman at all  if you want to argue against thewar then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keepkuwait  diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffectivewell in a sense yes  they probably had no idea of what end hitlerwould lead their nation tothey suffered along with the rest  why does this bother you so muchthe world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect  manyinnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others  it it regretablebut thats thewayitis  there are no perfect solutionsprobably because were not the saviors of the world  we cant police eachand every country that decides to selfdestruct or invade another  norare we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor orsome other placestell me how we could stop them and ill support it  i for one do notagree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put iti agree that it is deplorableare they  or are they supposed to reflect the population of the localewhere the trial is held  normally this is where the crime is committedunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venueis in order  im not an expert on california law or even us law butit seems that this is the way the system is set up  you can criticizethe system but lets not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown aroundno not at all  the point is that the fact that there were no blackson the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevantgermans perhaps  peers doesnt mean those who do the same thinglike having murderers judge murderers  it means having people fromthe same station in life presumably because they are in a betterposition to understand the defendents motivationsok granted  however you are using this reasoning as part of yourlogical argument in this discussion  this is not a court of lawthe media is not totally monolithic  even though there is a prevailingliberal bias programs such as the macneillehrer news hour try to givea balanced and fair reporting of the news  there are even conservativesources out there if you know where to look  hurrah for rushbtw i never used the word conspiracy  i dont accept without farmore evidence theories that there is some allpervading liberalconspiracy attempting to take over all news sourceshardly  i didnt say that its a good thing tm to kill innocent peopleif the end is just  unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world andthere are no perfect solutions  if one is going to  resist tyranny theninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die  i didnt sayit is ok  it is unfortunate but sometimes necessaryi would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much painand suffering  im not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say  thatconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involvedand perhaps it was unnecessary as lets say we now know  that doesntmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didnt see it asbeing necessary  rarely can one have full known of the consequences ofan action before making a decision  at the time it may have seemednecessary enough to go ahead with itbut dont assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified  idont  i just dont condemn those who had to make a difficultdecision under difficult circumstancesyou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativisti as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgmentwrong  they were neither moral then nor now  they seemed necessary tothose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war  i simplyrefuse to condemn them for their decisionone day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and actioneven this discourse in this forum  i understand the full ramifications ofthat and i am prepared to do so  i dont believe that you can make thesame claimand btw the reason i brought up the blanketbombing in germany wasbecause you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable  yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombingwasnt accurate enough to hit industrialmilitary targets in adecisive way by any other method at that time  but in the gulf warprecision bombing was the norm  so the point was why make a bigstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resultedin spite of precision bombing when so many more civiliansproportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombingin ww2  even with precision bombing mistakes happen and somecivilians suffer  but less civilians suffered in this war thanany other iany other in history  many iraqi civilians went about their liveswith minimal interference from the allied air raids  the storiesof hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunkyes bunk  the us lost 230000 servicemen in ww2 over four yearsand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting  but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months  and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that  what hogwash  if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombingregards,0,atheism,soc.religion.christian

in article  casper c knies as a latterday saint i found johns statement not at all ludicrousplease allow me to explain myself  in 1838 the governor of missourigovernor boggs issued his socalled mormon extermination order  theonly crime illegal activity the latterday saints had committed wastheir religious affiliation their antislave stance missouri stillallowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in missourii guess the mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bowto the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities this disobediencebrought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion fromtheir lands and settlementsit is significant to remember that these secular positions were held byaverage people and that at the time almost all americans were prettyhomogeonously christian it was largely the mainstream christians disgustat such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatredtrue but that is exactly the problem the mormon extermination orderwas issued not just by a christian it was allowed under the constitutionof the united states which was instituted precisely to prevent incidentslike this order from occurring in the first place  as i indicated inan earlier posting your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced byindividuals like robert weiss who could have been gov boggs lieutenanthe would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a moderndayoccurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentationlies denying mormons representation in their own user group etc etcin intent and purpose what really has changedthe situation is not entirely different today  many irrational feelingsand beliefs are justified through religion  i dont think most of themare started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify andperpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justificationwhich discourages critical thoughttrue as evidenced by numerous examples as i am sure youre awarein any regard mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities andi dont even discuss how uthans were suckered into allowing part of theirlands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far frombeing trusted or righteous  have things really changed for the better  imay be a born cynic but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been thecase in the early 1980s i believe the late president kimball lds churchleader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mxpeace keepermissile maze from being built in utah yet another inspired decision fromsecular authorities  fortunately his opposition was influential enoughfor the feds to back offdo you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group ofpeople with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating themormons  do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah fornuclear testing etc was to get them thar mormons  and what about themajority of uthans who arent mormons  you seem to be searching for enemy correction the majority of utahns are mormon 6070 i believe up to a 100 in many cities and settlements throughout the western statesconspiracies  it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects youbadly must have been done primarily for that purposewhat i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believethat satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to diverttruth judgment and justice  in addition we believe that the adversaryhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would bea good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression andevil combinations  as an intelligent being dont you suppose that thedestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political poweras far as utah is concerned what i pointed out were some horrible examplesof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which havebrought death disease ie the downwinders and environmental contamination  i am hardly paranoid i am just not expecting too much from asecular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeedas gov boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us  as a matter offact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years globalpersecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope thatparaphrasing all those who wish to escape persecution and murder mustflee to zion  zion the pure in heart will be reestablished in thosedays and it aint our current secular authorities who will rule over it  david koresh did not pose a greatthreat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and withjohn i too wonder who or whats nexti personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to thelife of even one person  sure he did not pose a threat to the security ofthis nation  but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  thatmuch is definitehmmm  definite by whom  until such has been established beyond reasonable doubt this alleged threat may have been less than the threatimposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbiwho killed who  what constitutional right did the atf officers have toinvade upon private land and to force themselves into the compoundwhat really caused the murder of the little children  could it be thatthe atffbi presence has any bearing upon the events  how would youinterpret the mt masada events  blame the jews  what the heck didthe romans do there anyway  what business did the atffbi has in wacotexas  the branch davidians never posed any threat to societythis is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympicteam in 1976  in that case the police botched the job as well  but tolay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terriblemistake  i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this casecertainly if david koresh chose any peaceful option the atf and fbiwould have complied  the responsibility is more his than the authoritiescome now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwisepeaceful standoff lets get it over with and force david koresh tocome out  by gassing them  were they naive or what  they playedright into the hands of an apocalypticthinking individual he had preparedhis people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or planwas in place to deal with this scenario  i feel that the authoritieshad some responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they werereligious zealots and guilty of  not paying a 200 gun licensehas the batf become an extension of the local taxcollectorsdavid koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by theexecutioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officerscharacterizing the atffbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  inorder to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intentto killque intrusion into private property with semis loaded with lifeammunition isnt that implicit intent or at least prepared to killi ask you would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justicei do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug lords are brought tojustice but

the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way overexaggerated and exploited for antiwar emotionalism by the liberal news media  thefacts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century  this was due mostlyto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniqueswhich were technically possible only recentlythe idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died isludicrous  not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers diedand they were the ones being targeted  or do you think that the usand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilianseither the smart bombs didnt hit their targets and we know they didor they were targeting civilian targets  which is hardly condusive todestroying iraqs military potential  the military mission planners arenot fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a warhitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against younot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against theirtyrantdictator how about all the innocent people who died in blanketbombing in ww2i dont hear you bemoaning them  war is never an exact science butwith smart bombs its becoming more exact with a smaller percentageof civilian casualties  sometimes mistakes are made targets aremisidentified innocents die  thats war the way it really isbut the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earthlike its one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get isworse  like patrick henry said some 217 years ago i know not whatcourse others may take  but as for me give me liberty or give medeath  war is always the price one must be willing to pay if onewishes to stay free   mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely offbase hereyou come off sounding like a complete peacenik idiot although ifeel sure that was not your intentso the iraqi war was wrong eh  im sure that appeasement would haveworked better than war just like it did in ww2 eh  i guess weshouldnt have fought ww2 either  just think of all those innocentgerman civilians killed in dresden and hamburg  how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent  we should have just let hitler take over europe and youd be speakinggerman instead of english right nowtyrants like hussein have to be stopped  his kind dont understanddiplomacy they only understand the point of a gun  my only regret isthat bush wimped out and didnt have the military roll into baghdad sonow hussein is still in power and the iraqi peoples sacrifice not tomention the 357 americans who died was for naught  liberating kuwait was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map wouldve been betterand as for poor poor rodney king  did you ever stop and think whythe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guiltythose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of thosepolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tapebut the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and ihave not seen  when one makes a judgment without the benefit of atrial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simplylowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a stateofmindwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tendsto support in the case against the policemen  law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accusedwhether they be criminals or cops  one is not found guilty if there isa reasonable doubt of ones guilt and only the jury is in a positionto assess the evidence and render a verdict  anyone else is simplysuccumbing to verbal vigilantism       regards,0,atheism,alt.atheism

tonyi read your post it was nothing new i had seen much the same in othertypicalchristian antigay sentimental literature  gay people are and willcon tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates  you maybe unaware of all the statistica findings concerning africanamericans thathave been published and used by various groups to reenforce their own biasagainst africanamericans  we usually think of the kkk in these instancesbut there are many other groups  of course the vast majority of the publicscoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the casefortunately africanamericans had whites who supported their cause andpublic sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around  there waseven a civil war and antinegro sentiment increased  in fact until lawswere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was prettymuch legal to discriminate against themi know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be freeform discrimination  you may think that i have been deceived or somethingthat is your perogative  my church christian church disciples of christopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of societyincluding gays  we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creationand making disciples  we believe in the lords great commandment to loveand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popularto do so  i really like my church for last reason the most  i can find achurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believesin the commandment of love though im hardpressed to find many who actuallysho love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especiallywithin their own community  i may have lost face with the greater christiancommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionistsagainst the oppression of africanamericans  many were even killed andtreated as runaway slaves for being niggerlovers and such  i guess ivedecided the challenge is worth itin my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragicstory centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straightwho have been hurt in the process etc  funny thing is i dont know of onecase where the parents exwives or even children have continued to rejecttheir gay family member son daughter exhusband father etc after theybegan to take part in some form of support group like pflagim apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado and am equally out0raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon from the tradition valuescoalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garnersupport within several 8 i believe states this coming november for moreoppressive legisation against gaysperhaps you dont get it and maybe you never will  many didnt get it in themiddle ages and the proclaimed gods will be done as they massacred thousandsin witch hunts and inquisitionsthe message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gayrights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike evenhatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it doesnt changethe results  the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end thefinal effect of posts like that of yours and mr hudson is that you have aconditional love for gays  condition  change and well love you this issure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an unconditionallove one that calls people just as they are  sure there are things thatwill naturally change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc thatneed to be changed through some sort of therapy  but then there are thingslike lefthandedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people isgoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to otherpeoples expectations in the process this coerced conformity causes manypeople a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who havenothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about theirown sense of pseuperspiritualitythis is sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change  it may beunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do withsomething very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but ifirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulationon thier bedrooms  its funny that most straight people have successfullyremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislationbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repressionas though ithelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of societygay people are not criminalsanother interesting thing happened recently  a very prominent charismaticchurch in the silicon valley here had two of its pastors arrested for selfadmitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys  this had apparentlybeen going on for some time a couple years but since the charges werevoluntary and the church worked closely with the police so i imagine thatwas how they managed to downplay it in the media  how could such a thinghappen when the church itself has an exgay ministry  one of my friendsrecently told me he was approached by someone who is going through thereparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request fordinner was not an invitation to attend the ministrythese are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments andcreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is notthe call of the christian community  the results of the passing amendment incolorado has created an organization whos posters are appearing all overcolorado called straight i forget the whole definition off handbut the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash and their mottois working for a fagfree america with an implicit advocation for violencethis is sick and it seems to be what you and mr hudson and others areembracingwe christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppressiontowards those we feel dont measure up and constant beratement fromorganizations like the christian research institute while they do have a goodpurpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better ways ofexcluding peoplethe gospel i believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to includepeople  i have several of dr martins books and find them quite helpfulespecially concerning cults but it seems that cri has become a cult untoitself  why dont we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring peopleto jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them awaywhatever,19,misc,soc.religion.christian
