"one of the most boring,pointless movies i have ever seen.  ",neg
"this movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",neg
i will never forget it now.  ,pos
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful.  ,pos
"both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  ",pos
it is a really good show to watch.  ,pos
this movie is so awesome!  ,pos
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.  ,pos
"personally, i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  ",pos
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  ,pos
"as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening.  ",pos
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  ,pos
both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  ,pos
hated it.  ,neg
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized!  ,pos
the film looks cheap and bland.  ,neg
"it's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  ",neg
"director paul matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  ",neg
"hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  ",neg
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ,neg
"this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ",neg
"but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  ",neg
"for people who are first timers in film making, i think they did an excellent job!!  ",pos
fans of the genre will be in heaven.  ,pos
"the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  ",pos
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,pos
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  ,pos
the poor actors.  ,neg
"utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",neg
"there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  ",pos
"both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  ",neg
"i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  ",neg
"however paul schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" mishima that is both superb & complex.  ",pos
10/10  ,pos
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr.  ,pos
"i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.  ",neg
"unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  ",neg
mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,neg
this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  ,pos
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  ,pos
"i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  ",neg
great movie!  ,pos
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside.  ,neg
it is a very well acted and done tv movie.  ,pos
"it had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  ",neg
hitchcock is a great director.  ,pos
a good film by a great director!  ,pos
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  ,neg
i couldn't take them seriously.  ,neg
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ,neg
"then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ",neg
") some great music, and terrific scenery.  ",pos
an excellent performance from ms.  ,pos
this is the number one best th game in the series.  ,pos
"he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  ",neg
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  ,neg
"it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ",pos
"okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  ",pos
this movie has a cutting edge to it.  ,pos
"the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  ",pos
"if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  ",pos
"it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella ""the dead.  ",pos
"it has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good.  ",pos
it was so cool.  ,pos
it just blew.  ,neg
it deserves strong love.  ,pos
there was nothing believable about it at all.  ,neg
and those baby owls were adorable.  ,pos
see it.  ,pos
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,neg
"the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  ",neg
"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  ",neg
"but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet, their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  ",pos
"call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever.  ",pos
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard.  ,pos
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  ,pos
the rest of the cast also play well.  ,pos
"whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  ",neg
"the rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... if it's about emptiness, it works i guess because it's empty.  ",neg
"in fact, i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat (stuart townsend) better than cruise's attempt.  ",pos
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series.  ,pos
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,pos
"i think it was robert ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  ",pos
a great film by a great director.  ,pos
"it's just adorable seeing mickey playing ""turkey in the straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  ",pos
"artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  ",neg
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell.  ,neg
one of the worst shows of all time.  ,neg
"i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  ",pos
"you can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ",neg
"the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  ",pos
"macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  ",pos
"i don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  ",pos
"frankly, after cotton club and unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film, because it is bad.  ",neg
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  ,pos
the visual effects were awful.  ,neg
"an instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ",pos
there is no real plot.  ,neg
"the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  ",pos
i liked this movie way too much.  ,pos
"she is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  ",pos
"and, finally, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell.  ",neg
"the film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  ",pos
""" the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  ",pos
"i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  ",pos
there are some generally great things in it.  ,pos
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,neg
so bad...well...it's just bad.  ,neg
the story line is totally predictable.  ,neg
"im big fan of rpg games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is.  ",neg
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  ,pos
"if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  ",pos
this is a stunning movie.  ,pos
i was very disappointed in the movie.  ,neg
"it was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  ",neg
"in fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  ",neg
everything about this movie is stupid.  ,neg
"people who like european films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  ",pos
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ,neg
the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  ,pos
"the sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode.  ",neg
"the film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen.  ",pos
"either way, it sucks.  ",neg
"attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ",neg
this movie is terrible.  ,neg
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  ,neg
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  ,pos
"it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",neg
"it's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  ",neg
this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  ,neg
"excellent cast, story line, performances.  ",pos
"but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  ",neg
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the president of the u.s.  ,neg
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,pos
a bit predictable.  ,neg
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  ,neg
i keep watching it over and over.  ,pos
it's pure brilliance.  ,pos
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  ,pos
avoid at all costs.  ,neg
"i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child.  ",pos
the script iswas there a script?  ,neg
"this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ",neg
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,pos
ray charles is legendary.  ,pos
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  ,pos
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence.  ,neg
the camera really likes her in this movie.  ,pos
"it's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  ",pos
"camerawork - again, bad.  ",neg
"very true to shakespear, and a 'must' for all shakespear fans.  ",pos
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,neg
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  ,neg
"i just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.the junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.too funny i laughed,kids will love it.buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  ",pos
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor!  ,pos
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,neg
"even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  ",neg
"and i forgot: the casting here i superb, with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  ",pos
"i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  ",pos
"i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  ",neg
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  ,neg
"every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  ",neg
the problem was the script.  ,neg
i sat riveted to the tv screen.  ,pos
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  ,neg
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  ,neg
what the hell kind of crap is that?!  ,neg
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's.  ,pos
this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  ,neg
but it picked up speed and got right to the point.  ,pos
"of course, the acting is blah.  ",neg
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film.  ,pos
"but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  ",pos
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ,neg
"highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  ",pos
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,neg
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,neg
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,neg
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  ,neg
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,pos
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  ,pos
editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  ,pos
"the lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  ",neg
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  ,pos
"if you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  ",neg
my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  ,pos
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  ,neg
"bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  ",neg
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ,pos
"and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  ",pos
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,neg
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  ,pos
excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver !  ,pos
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  ,pos
"so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  ",pos
"i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  ",pos
clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ,pos
"i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic.  ",neg
"so i am here to warn you--do not rent this movie, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  ",neg
"the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  ",neg
"the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  ",neg
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  ,neg
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,neg
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws.  ,neg
"it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  ",neg
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  ,pos
it is shameful.  ,neg
"i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  ",neg
go and see it!  ,pos
then the film just dropped the ball.  ,neg
"all things considered, a job very well done.  ",pos
"the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen.  ",neg
definitely worth checking out.  ,pos
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  ,pos
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  ,neg
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar.  ,pos
"yes, i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  ",neg
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off!  ,neg
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie.  ,neg
juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south.  ,pos
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering.  ,pos
didn't laugh or even smile once.  ,neg
i gave it a 10  ,pos
"this is one i did not have, but i watched it recently on fox movie channel, and was very disappointed.  ",neg
"it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".  ",pos
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  ,pos
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  ,neg
"to sum the film up, ""breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus.  ",neg
"i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  ",pos
"victor mclaglen was even bad, and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable.  ",neg
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ,neg
"i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  ",pos
"shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style, watkins creates a film like no other.  ",pos
even worse than ticker!  ,neg
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  ,pos
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ,neg
what on earth is irons doing in this film?  ,neg
"this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  ",pos
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  ,neg
everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,pos
the cast is good.  ,pos
"and, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ",neg
"initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in buffalo, intrigued me.  ",pos
"stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility.  ",pos
and i really did find them funny.  ,pos
"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  ",pos
"then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th, 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing.  ",pos
now this is a movie i really dislike.  ,neg
the kids are annoying.  ,neg
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ,pos
""" in fact, it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  ",pos
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life.  ,neg
"often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",neg
"he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  ",neg
so bad.  ,neg
excellent short film.  ,pos
"oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ",neg
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  ,neg
"the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  ",neg
"i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  ",neg
"however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ",neg
highly unrecommended.  ,neg
"at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar's cgi masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  ",pos
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  ,neg
wasted two hours.  ,neg
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  ,neg
i just saw this film and i recommend it.  ,pos
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  ,pos
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  ,neg
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  ,neg
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz.  ,pos
"even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  ",neg
"but she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  ",neg
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  ,pos
i'll give this film 10 out of 10!  ,pos
"i loved it, it was really scary.  ",pos
"here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age.  ",pos
"the new characters weren't all that memorable, and i found myself forgetting who was who.  ",neg
it's like a bad two hour tv movie.  ,neg
that was nice.  ,pos
"the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  ",pos
this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  ,pos
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,neg
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,pos
"funny, clever, hip - just like pray's previous film, hype!  ",pos
the worst one of the series.  ,neg
"secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",pos
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  ,pos
the movie seemed a little slow at first.  ,neg
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time!  ,pos
"there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",neg
"the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  ",pos
this is not movie-making.  ,neg
all of the main players are mesmerising.  ,pos
"saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  ",pos
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  ,neg
"this movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  ",neg
"wow, what a bad film.  ",neg
nothing new there.  ,neg
i wasn't the least bit interested.  ,neg
also the story and acting were weak.  ,neg
"not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",neg
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ,pos
"again, lame.  ",neg
"it felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  ",pos
don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  ,pos
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ,pos
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  ,pos
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  ,pos
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  ,pos
"the results, well, are a shame.  ",neg
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back.  ,neg
not recommended.  ,neg
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  ,pos
the music in the film is really nice too.  ,pos
"ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",pos
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,neg
the film is way too long.  ,neg
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review!  ,neg
the lead man is charisma-free.  ,neg
here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  ,neg
"it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  ",neg
"overall, a delight!  ",pos
"he owns the film, just as spacek owned ""coal miner's daughter"" and quaid owned ""great balls of fire.  ",pos
"the plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  ",neg
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle.  ,pos
"to be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ",neg
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,neg
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  ,neg
"gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  ",pos
excellent performance.  ,pos
dee snider just plain sucks.  ,neg
"it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  ",neg
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  ,neg
"this movie contained an all-star cast, and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before.  ",pos
"i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  ",neg
"garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work, but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",pos
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  ,neg
"the acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  ",pos
the acting is beyond abysmal.  ,neg
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  ,pos
not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  ,pos
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  ,neg
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  ,pos
up there with the best of melville.  ,pos
the film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  ,neg
"the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  ",neg
